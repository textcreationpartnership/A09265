         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AVTHORS of new deuices are ſelfe pleaſing, they are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and like onely their owne inuentions: I perceiue it is in vaine to perſwade. Eaſier it is to draw a profane perſon from Hell gates, then to remoue an opinion from a wilfull minde. Schiſme is the Ship whereon goe aboard malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, the Windes that ſet it forward are violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Will is the Rudder, Obſtinacie the Anchor. Schiſmatickes are headſtrong, they will not ſee eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent conuiction: ſelfe-loue maketh them iudge the beſt of themſelues, but their want of Charitie very badly of others. They beguile themſelues with ſhew of pietie, heat of affection, and with a ſtrong appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of things greatly amiſſe in others. Theſe can they ſee with both eyes, themſelues with neither. No Church can paſſe them, wherein they cannot ſee a rocke of offence, and a ſtone to ſtumble at. They keepe a loofe off from all, they leaue one Church, and come not at another; alone they loue to be; ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is their path-way. The common roade of the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:14152:7"/> reformed Churches is too foule for their ſinceritie. Our arguments againſt them are paper ſhot, as they hold: but their weakeſt reaſons againſt vs (if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may iudge) are ſhot of Cannon. They deſpiſe euery mans endeauour againſt them, and are in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration with their owne workes. Let any conferre with them, and they ſhall heare it, I my ſelfe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently haue experience of it. By this might I be moued to ceaſe this ſecond labour; but I am not hopeleſſe to hold ſome men back, &amp; to gaine ſome alſo, though I cannot recouer what is wholie already loſt. If I might ſpeed in both I would be glad, if but in one, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: in both to looſe my labour, I cannot doubt.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt here (gentle Reader) an Anſwere of mine, and alſo a Reply vnto an Anſwere made by one by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> the Doctor, ſo called, of the Schiſmaticall Church of <hi>Brouniſts</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> His anſwere is, to my booke called the <hi>Separatiſts Schiſme:</hi> what wee both ſay, I pray thee iudge after tryall. Let it pleaſe thee to reade my former booke, to diſcerne what I hold, and here ſtill maintaine. If thou haſt hap to light vpon this Anſwerers booke, ſo read it, as thou alſo compare mine and it together. Much hath he omitted in my booke, the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> wholy, and all <hi>the Counſels of Peace:</hi> wherein are ſomethings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture, in the reading whereof thou ſhalt not iudge time loſt. This Anſwerer in his booke onely once doth mention them, but with this his Comment vpon me, that <hi>perhaps I knew no more then</hi> CAIPHAS <hi>what I ſaid.</hi> It is well yet, that the worke is approued, though hee iudge the Author ignorant of his owne
<pb facs="tcp:14152:7"/> inuented labour. He hath alſo paſſed ouer very much in the matter of the Booke, touching the chiefe points betweene vs and them: and therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to iudge of his anſwere, and to ſee the truth, read my other Booke.</p>
            <p>I obſerue an humour in men ariſing of idleneſſe, or of careleſneſſe, or of loue onely of nouelties, or of them all, to reade the laſt onely, and to neglect what before hath bene written, ſo take they opinions without tryall, iudge without ſearching, but ſo can hold nothing certaine. A reaſon to diſſwade men from writing in matters of controuerſie, except wee doe write all on both ſides, and make a great volume of a penny Pamphlet, which is too toyleſome, and alſo ſuperfluous, when bookes may be compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>When I was writing ouer my reply to this M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth:</hi> which I had thought ſhould haue gone forth ſo alone, I receiued by Gods good prouidence the <hi>Se-baptiſts</hi> booke, I meane M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> anſwere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that ſo it might not boaſt like an <hi>Heatheniſh Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias,</hi> againſt Gods Church, without an encounter, I haue therfore placed him, and ranked him in his due order as he came, &amp; made anſwere therto as is meet, leſt this <hi>wofull man</hi> ſhould ſtill miſlead others, as he doth his owne ſelfe, by his braine-ſickneſſe: I heare of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robinſons</hi> anſwere alſo; if it had come in, hee ſhould alſo haue beene replyed vpon. Though I be a weake man, and my weapons be againſt theſe three Captaines of three Companies, and but a ſtone in a ſling, yet ſhall Iſrael preuaile: the truth
<pb facs="tcp:14152:8"/> is ſtrong againſt all enemies whoſoeuer they be.</p>
            <p>They would ouer-loade me with number, but as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid, <hi>moe are with vs then againſt vs.</hi> Indeede I want the help of my brethren: yet I neither doe nor will bid, curſe <hi>Meroz,</hi> the Lord forgiue them their<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 23.</note> careleſneſſe, if not the hypocriſie of men herein. If we be the Lords people, why ſuffer we the Lord to be blaſphemed by theſe men? if we be not, why halt we betweene two opinions? If our ſtanding be of God, let vs maintaine it; if theſe men be in the true &amp; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way, let vs make a ſeperation; why ſtand wee idle in the market place? Here is worke, let vs labour in the Lords Vineyard, if (in our iudgement) it be the Lords Vineyard; els let vs be going. If I were not perſwaded in my ſoule, that here is the true Church of God, I profeſſe vnfainedly (by Gods help) that I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my ſtanding, whatſoeuer wicked and vnchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hearts cenſure to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But ſay ſome, theſe men will neuer be anſwered. No more will the great Aduerſarie (hee and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments are importunate) yet muſt hee and they be euer reſiſted, till they flye from vs. Men feare the end, before they beginne: remoue careleſneſſe and idleneſſe, and behold the iſſue. If thou wilt not be publike, write in priuate. They raile (ſome ſay) and abuſe men, what then? God will be auenged on <hi>Rabſhakehs:</hi> and their cauſe gaineth nothing by their bitterneſſe. For my part, I will endeuour to further the truth, as farre as I ſhall be able to giue anſwere to what may be ſaid againſt it; for their ill carriage, I will as well as I may beare it patiently. I hope I haue
<pb facs="tcp:14152:8"/> in this, publiſhed ſufficiently to the world my Faith and reſolution, in this particuler truth of the Church, in contending with theſe our aduerſaries. In time, if time may be granted me, I haue a purpoſe to ſet downe, ſo the truth of this point, concerning a true, and a falſe Church, by definitions, and diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, declaring the properties and priuiledges of the Church inuiſible and viſible, and ſo of the militant and triumphant, as the order with the ſeuerall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof ſhall require: and thereto as an euident plaineneſſe of the ſame to all, I will adde an Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical narration of the Church out of the Scriptures, from the creation of the world, and ſo farre as the Scriptures euidently declare it: wherein I will, by Gods help, obſerue the <hi>matter of the Church,</hi> the <hi>Worſhip,</hi> the <hi>Gouernment,</hi> and the <hi>Gouernours of the ſame,</hi> as may giue indifferent men a godly ſatisfaction in this point of controuerſie, if other more fit for this, doe not performe it. In the meane ſpace, I iudge that herein I haue performed on my behalfe, what I ought, and what was expected at my hands to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, for the honour of God, the reuerence of our Church, the credit of mine owne miniſterie, the veritie of my vndertaken cauſe againſt theſe Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes, and withall for a iuſt defence of mine owne perſon, wickedly traduced by ſome. I looke not to ſatisfie the <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> much leſſe the ſtrange man M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> the <hi>Se-baptiſt;</hi> how can a man quiet them that loue contention? I haue endeuoured to performe a duety, whereunto I haue beene iuſtly called, as I haue ſhewed in my former Booke; what men may
<pb facs="tcp:14152:9"/> imagine I know not; how they will iudge of my good purpoſe, I much reckon not; let conſcience acquite mee, though all condemne me, I much care not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit I deſire the approbation euer of thee a godly and iudicious Reader: if ſo thou beeſt.</p>
            <p>I leaue thee friend to peruſe this labour, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the cauſe, as of great moment, to thy conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: weigh well the matter, iudge of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, anſweres, and the reply without partialitie; let thine vpright heart effect, as thy right knowledge in euery thing ſhall ſettle thy iudgement and conuince thy conſcience. I leaue euery one to their owne liking, approue or diſallow, doe their owne wils, ſo will men in theſe dayes, I am one in my ſelfe, to them indifferent: let Truth preuaile and God receiue glory.</p>

I then rebell not againſt the light receiued, but by the light reſiſt I darkneſſe, as I iudge their vncharitable cenſuring, ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and condemning of vs to be. I wiſh themſelues not to be rebellious againſt God, againſt his Church, and againſt the light of our louing endeuours in the truth, to reduce them to a better courſe, to ioyne to ſome refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Church, to be no more <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> that they breede no more <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi> But what if it had beene light, euen the truth of God, which I did ſeeme to regard, and yet with-ſtood my knowledge? can no better fruit then rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion be expected?

            <p>I grant the firſt, that <hi>I am an aduerſary,</hi> to wit, <hi>to their Schiſme;</hi> but I deny the latter, that therefore I fight againſt the truth, that is the matter in queſtion; though in my iudgement it is out of queſtion that their ſeparation is not truth, but the errour of Schiſme and Schiſmatickes.</p>

            </p>
            <p>[<hi>A while ſince.</hi>] Time is an inſtructer to a diligent ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher; I ſee now, what I then ſaw not; if I had, the late <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts</hi> had not miſled ſo many: the <hi>few,</hi> or rather the <hi>none,</hi> which now they doe winne here-away manifeſteth the ſame.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Needes.</hi>] What neceſſitie was there? if I would, I might haue gone the way, they were gentle entertainers, (moſt ſeely ones were receiued, ſuch as now the Anabaptiſts haue reiected) I needed not to haue made any forcible intruſion. But the man here ſpeaks now beſides his Booke; it's not materiall, he hath hereof a ſupporter, his Talebearer.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:14152:11"/>
            <p>[<hi>Seeme to fauour</hi>] A fauour is no ſound approbation: and a ſeeming fauour, is a very ſmall allowance. Out of theſe words it may appeare, that I was neyther a <hi>Leader,</hi> nor a <hi>Setter of others on</hi> as, lewdly by words, malicious men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye me: I profeſſe my ſelfe moſt ignorant of what a Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt held, before M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> and his followers went that way; I neuer ſaw a Booke of theirs, nor to my knowledge, the face of a man in the way of the Separation. I confeſſe I was much moued with faire ſhewes of Scripture, and with great pretences of holineſſe in their way: but I was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued. Oh, but aske M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> why I was not remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; being ſo moued, why I went not forward? <hi>forſooth things not ſucceeding to mine expectation, I haue changed my loue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hatred.</hi> Mine expectation was onely the truth; I ſaw no ill ſucceſſe, but error of the way, which hindred my courſe. It is not therefore condemnable to change my loue into hate: Loue is an affection onely fit for the truth; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred muſt perſecute error. If a man at the firſt expect truth, and by tryall finde falſhoode, is it not fit to change affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to place them right, which through ignorance were before miſplaced? this man would finde a knot in a bul-ruſh; a fault where none is.</p>
            <p>[<hi>In the bitterneſſe of my zeale, I ſent out</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe.</hi>] Zeale, is laudable in a iuſt cauſe againſt ſlanderers of the truth, and the Church of God their mother: this Zeale liketh him not lukewarmeneſſe is beſt, it doth their cauſe no hurt: they would be let alone, that ſo they might ſtill deceiue the honeſt heart, and carry away the ſimple, to a right hand ſinne of Schiſme. I am commanded to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, the luke-warme will God ſpue out of his mouth: we haue too many <hi>Laodiceans;</hi> if wee were more zealous for the Lord of Hoaſts, much would be amended, Schiſmaticks and Heretickes would be abandoned: which I heartily pray for. Touching <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> the whole Booke defendeth me from ſo falſe an accuſation. For bitterneſſe let them looke to their grand Maſter, <hi>Barrow;</hi> whoſe ſpirit was the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of gall and Wormewood, as his railing, ſcoffing, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14152:11"/> other outrages doe ſhew in his Printed Bookes. <hi>It</hi> (to wit, my Booke, ſaith he) <hi>containeth diſſwaſions from the practiſe of the Goſpell.</hi> Here he changeth the Title of my Booke, to inlarge his ſinne; He calleth <hi>their Inuentions, Goſpell;</hi> and <hi>their Schiſme</hi> from Gods Church, <hi>the practiſe of the Goſpell.</hi> Hee would put vpon me a labour full of wickedneſſe, but he beggeth that which he can neuer make good, nor I euer yeeld him.</p>
            <p>How is it that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> hath found out their Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall practiſe, to be no practiſe of the Goſpell, but the inuention of man, hauing both an Antichriſtian miniſterie and gouernment in it?

                  <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>It can neuer be proued by the Scriptures, that there was but one Paſtor in a Church.

                  <p>2 <hi>All Churches had Officers of one ſort, and one kind of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterie, and therefore as all the Elders of Epheſus were Paſtors, ſo were all the Elders of the ſixe Churches of Aſia, and of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches whereſoeuer in the world, if they had many Elders.</hi>

               <p>Out of themſelues may we ſee, is one riſen to condemne themſelues: a Pupill, a Tutor, a Scholler in Separatiſme, a grand Maſter in Browniſme. Hee hath mete vnto them, as they haue meaſured vnto vs: we are Antichriſtian, ſay they: They are Antichriſtian, ſaith he. What then haue they got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by their vncharitable and lewd Schiſme?</p>
               <p>Now to returne againe to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworths Foreſpeech,</hi> where I left it. He ſaith, that in my Booke, <hi>is little waight of reaſon or truth to be ſeene, nor any thing which may trouble a diſcreet Reader.</hi> In his firſt Foreſpeech, hee ſaid, my Booke had a ſhew, and but a ſhew of reaſon, now here hee allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it waight of reaſon, though he adde the word <hi>little.</hi> Hee giueth and taketh away, hee writeth he knowes not what. <hi>It hath little waight</hi> (ſaith he) but Reader compare his anſwere with my Booke, and thou maiſt ſee that hee found himſelfe ouerloden: the little waight of reaſon, was more then hee could lift, as appeareth by all that which he hath left behind him. For <hi>truth to be ſeene;</hi> hee ſeeth not, the cauſe is in his blindneſſe, and not in the matter by me deliuered. One but <hi>meanly acquainted with their cauſe</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>may find out my
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14152:16"/> deceit.</hi> It is hard to finde what is not, plaineneſſe harboureth not ſuch a gueſt as deceit; how farre I am from fraudulent dealing, let the worke be iudge. If a meane acquaintance with their cauſe can ſo enlighten their eyes, as they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſee my dealing, and weeld the waight of my worke; what need this man ſpeake of a diſcreet Reader, and tell him of trouble too? where was his owne eyes? and what was become of his diſcretion in anſwering, that ſaw no more, and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſo little? He ſets my labour light, and yet cryeth to the Lord for wiſedome to anſwere me: He maketh the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt a fit Iudge for mee, and yet prayeth for an vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Reader to diſcerne me: how can theſe things ſtand together?</p>
               <p>He is conſtrained, it ſeemeth, by a greater power, to yeeld me in my labour more ſtudious endeuour, (though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe it in heart) then his ill will otherwiſe would afford. Thus it falleth out with them that againſt the ſhining light, ſtruggle, of an ill diſpoſition, to wipe away vndeſeruedly, what is due to others, for their owne praiſe.</p>
               <p>His end in anſwering (as he ſaith) <hi>is to ſtop my mouth, and to helpe the ſimple to preuent and to diſcerne,</hi> I know not what <hi>fraud</hi> of mine. He hath a meruailous conceit of his labour: he thought it ſhould come neere me, when hee meant with it to ſtoppe my mouth: but if hee thinke ſo idle an anſwere can put any to ſilence, hee is much deceiued; yet had hee ſtayed my pen, and preuented this labour, had hee but ſet out my whole labour with his anſwere: If this had beene done, a Reply had beene needleſſe, ſo little hath he aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged his cauſe, or endamaged me by his anſwere, as indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and learned Readers haue iudged.</p>
               <p>He offers this as help <hi>to the ſimple:</hi> A fit choyſe, a ſimple anſwere to a ſimple Scholler. Simple is he indeed that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo ſeely a help. For <hi>preuenting of offence,</hi> he is ſo farre from it, as hee and his, with ſuch like, haue greatly increaſed it, haue cauſed many to fall, and the common aduerſary to aduance himſelfe againſt vs, to the great hinderance of the Goſpell, and to the hearts griefe of many a true Chriſtian
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14152:16"/> ſoule Such <hi>Preuentours</hi> of euill may be rather called <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentours</hi> of miſchiefe. Touching the imagined fraud, which he laieth to my charge, here he ſaith ſo, but no where in his anſwere proueth any ſuch thing; had hee found it, he would haue named it. Surely I was in mine intendment farre from it, and I confeſſe my ſelfe to be in nature one, as all that know me can witneſſe, as it were caſt into the mould of plaineneſſe: what I haue written, it was done in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of my heart, as I then was, and am perſwaded of the truth. Let fraud and falſhood ſticke to the ribs of the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but be it farre from me for euer.</p>
               <p>[<hi>He thought it needfull</hi> (as hee ſaith) <hi>to obſerue and anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were briefely the principall things by me obiected.</hi>] A generall anſwere is no anſwere: what muſt become of the particulars whereon the reader muſt ſtumble? The truth of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are eſtabliſhed in and by particulars, eyther therefore muſt theſe be refelled, or the other are not truely anſwered. But herein hee tooke his caſe: little credit to his cauſe, as by the <hi>Reply</hi> made, doth well appeare: yet in this caſe which hee tooke, hee neuertheleſſe would inſinuate, that therein hee laboured more then was needfull: for that <hi>many of the principals are in the Treatiſe (before written to Mr.</hi> Spr.) <hi>and in other Bookes more largely confuted.</hi> If hee haue refuted any principals of my labor in an other mans booke, it was an idle labour in him to ſay the ſame things againe vnto me, and omit particulars, which hee had neuer ſaid any thing vnto. This doth ſhew, that what hee thought he could anſwere, he ſpared not to afford thereto a double la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour but where he could not, there he craues pardon for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo much as once one ſingle anſwere. If he ſay true, that he hath refuted any thing of my Booke in any mans labor, I here tell him afore-hand, that in ſo doing, hee hath ſpared me ſo much labour: I meane fully to reply to his anſwere made to me, ſo much as it is, not doubting but the other can and will anſwere what commeth in his way, as I ſhould doe in the like caſe. What he meaneth by <hi>other Bookes,</hi> which he ſpeakes of, I know not, he nameth none. Belike hee

               <p>If this his anſwere ſerue not the turne, [<hi>All of them may</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>if need require, hereafter by ſome other be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refelled.</hi>] What he was not able to refute, (and yet would hee be a buſie vndertaker,) he leaueth for others to refell; <hi>if need ſhould require.</hi> How needfull it was, though this man make but an <hi>If</hi> therof, may appeare by an anſwer made now to the particulars, by the <hi>Se-baptiſt</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith,</hi> who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth this Anſwerer, for ſo leauing particulars without defence, to ſhift for themſelues in the plaine field: And therefore hee commeth forth as a <hi>Goliah,</hi> to fight for his owne gathered hoaſt of the Philiſtines; I meane his owne opinions, partly abſurd, and partly hereticall, which hee hath muſtred in his vnſtable braine by Sophiſtrie, through diſcontentment, to trouble the hoaſt of Iſrael, the true Church of God with vs.</p>
               <p>And thus much for an anſwere to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworths</hi> Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeeches: a man buſily intereſſing himſelfe in a cauſe, when it ſeemeth hee knew another to owne it, and to goe about to defend it. Hee ſhould haue ſuffred the other to haue gone before him, except hee could haue fore-ſtalled him for the cauſe, which hee vndertooke rather (as may ſeeme) to diſclaime, denying many things, skipping ouer moſt things, then to defend any thing, for that hee anſwereth nothing ſoundly: ſee Reader and iudge.</p>

Indeed I was not requeſted by this Childes Parents to be an vnder-taker, neuertheleſſe vpon ſo extraordinarie an act, I will be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what exorbitant with my ſelf, to cal him M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Smith,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſticall Se-baptiſt.</hi> Notorious acts, wee may reade, haue made men remarkable, and haue gotten them names and titles, for a memoriall of the facts and deeds done; why ſhould not hee then obtaine what worthily hee hath deſerued? hee is <hi>Anabaptiſticall,</hi> for rebaptization; and he is a <hi>Se-baptiſt,</hi> becauſe hee did baptiſe himſelfe; it is more then Chriſt would doe: but hee could finde no whither to<note place="margin">So he thought of Baptiſme in Reformed Churches; yea, and among the Separation.</note> goe for Baptiſme; in <hi>ſome Churches</hi> it was falſe, as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; in <hi>ſome true,</hi> but not lawfully to be receiued, becauſe of ſome <note n="*" place="margin">As onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</note> Hereſies. But is his Baptiſme true? No verily, if himſelfe may be made Iudge: for in his Anſwere to mee, page 91. line 28. he ſaith, <hi>that a baptiſed perſon muſt baptiſe into the true faith of Chriſt, a perſon capable of baptiſme,</hi> elſe it is not a true Sacrament. Now M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> did baptiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and was not before by his own iudgement &amp; profeſſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14152:18"/> baptiſed; ſo a perſon vnbaptiſed did baptiſe: and therefore it is no true Sacrament by his owne doctrine, as alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable from the Scripture. And therefore all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany haue receiued by him corruption, they haue made a falſe entrance into their new way, by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony. Hee would not goe to others to be baptiſed, for then hee ſhould haue beene of their Fraternitie, and ſo haue loſt his owne company; but he would none of that.</p>
               <p>Hee layeth to my charge inconſtancy: but I profeſſe I was neuer of them: indeed through ignorance, which ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that for light which is darkneſſe, and through affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lead by ignorance, and held on by a fooliſh good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I was toſſed by the preſent tempeſt, ſometime to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring, but otherwhile to a great diſlike; vntill by ſtudy, and other endeuours, I found out a certaine truth to reſt vpon, and ſo ſtuck to my old, former and firſt way, wherein I doe walke: is this, as he termeth it, inconſtancy, Apoſtacie? Is this to be often of and on, as it hath fallen out with him; whoſe iudgement is inſtabilitie it ſelfe, whoſe courſe is as changeable as the Moone? for:</p>
               <p>Firſt, hee was a <hi>Subſcriber, a Conformitant,</hi> and as honeſt<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> changeablenes.</note> a man then, as euer ſince, for any thing ſeene or heard hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto to the contrary: this is euident, when firſt hee was made Miniſter, and when hee was inſtituted into a liuing. Whether wholy a Conformiſt, he beſt knoweth: it is enough that he was, what he was.</p>
               <p>Secondly he fell from that, but <hi>allowed the authoritie of Biſhops,</hi> and publiſhed his <hi>diſlike</hi> againſt a great point of <hi>Browniſme,</hi> touching ſet Prayer, the ſaying of the Lords<note place="margin">Booke on the Lords Prayer. pag. 91. and in the Epiſtle to the Reader.</note> Prayer: and ſaid in his <hi>then</hi> iudgement, that it was the <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured truth.</hi>

               <p>Fiftly, for all this <hi>hee fell</hi> quite from vs <hi>againe to Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi>

               <p>Sixtly, within a while this <hi>Proteſtation</hi> for that ſo great a truth, <hi>turned into deteſtation</hi> againſt it, as a falſhood; and that clearnes as noon day became in his new after thoughts as darkneſſe at midnight. Hee holdeth for truths, what M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in his anſwere to me, reiecteth for errors: Hee iudgeth their worſhip in part Iudaiſme; their Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<note place="margin">See his Booke of Differences.</note> and Gouernment Antichriſtian; of which hee hath alſo publiſhed a Booke, and there in the Epiſtle (becauſe he is found ſo inconſtant, to wipe away the ſhame thereof, and to cut off offence for afterward) hee without ſhame, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to be vnconſtant,</hi> and deſireth that <hi>euer his laſt writing ſhould be taken as his preſent iudgement;</hi> ſo there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine where he will hold. <hi>Miſerable people</hi> will you ſtill be led by ſo <hi>changeable a Chamaeleon!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seauenthly, and laſtly, if it proue the laſt, <hi>He hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a new Church,</hi> hee hath (if you will beleeue him) reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the true Baptiſme, and the true matter and forme of a true Church, which now is onely to be found pure among a company of <hi>Se-baptiſts.</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> will <note n="*" place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> loues ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to be one alone with his company, that is his politicke humilitie.</note> hold euer this word (<hi>Se</hi>) to himſelfe, for in going into Browniſme, hee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14152:19"/> was a ſeparatiſt, he held differing opinions from them, and now that he is in Anabaptiſme, hee is a Se-baptiſt, he who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goeth not with that Hereticall Sect. It may ſeeme he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to haue an Oare in euery Boat, and a piece of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profeſſion; holding all, and none wholy, and yet will ſuppoſe himſelfe the beſt, as if hee were an vnerring Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, hauing an infallible rule <hi>in Scrinio pectoris</hi> to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally good. If he hold this, let him ſhew his authoritie from aboue, and then haue wee done. But I ſee already, without farther time to reade his commiſſion, that he is out of the way. Baptiſme (ſaith he) is the doore into the Church: there muſt be then a Church, and a doore into the Church. I aske therefore whether the viſible Church was among them or no, when M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> did baptiſe himſelfe? If he ſay it was none, then he entred into that which was not, ſo a doore was without an houſe: &amp; Baptiſme before the Church. If he ſay, they were the Church: I aske how could a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church be before there be true matter of a Church, that is, a company truely baptiſed as they hold? His action is therefore altogether extraordinary without Scripture, without practiſe of Gods Church formerly: and therefore muſt he herein haue an extraordinarie warrant, or elſe he is extraordinarily preſumptuouſly wicked. But by this trick is he diſpaſtored, and is but among them as a priuate perſon, till he be againe elected; this is moſt true: And thus hath he beene off and on in the Miniſterie two or three times. He was made Miniſter by Biſhop <hi>Wickam,</hi> that by and by in <hi>Browniſme</hi> he renounced; &amp; was made Miniſter by Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and called himſelfe, <hi>The Paſtour of the Church at Gainſbrough:</hi> this hath he loſt againe, by his <hi>Se-baptiſticke</hi> way, till he be choſen againe.</p>
               <p>Thus is his inconſtancie apparant, and cauſe ſufficient<note place="margin">He himſelfe doth ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw daily himſelfe, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſufficient to let him alone: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

               <p>Hee ſuppoſeth himſelfe vnanſwerable; and therefore he bids me battell. Truth is vnanſwerable, but errors broached from an vnſtable iudgement are confutable.

               <p>Thirdly, By idle and very friuolous diſtinctions: as a Miniſter doth conuert ſoules, not as a <hi>Paſtour,</hi> but as a <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:</hi> as if a Paſtour were not a Teacher, when he ſaith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, they be one and the ſame office: here is abſurditie and forgetfulneſſe, or Vnſtableneſſe in iudgement.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, By moſt ridiculous abſurd <note n="a" place="margin">Abſurd and and beaſtly ſimilies.</note> ſimilies, and one very beaſtly, by which he would ſet out our Church, from the mingled ſeed of an Horſe and an Aſſe in generation, producing a third thing, but neither a true Horſe, nor a true Aſſe: ſo is it (ſaith he) where good and bad perſons are ioined together: he mentioneth this two or three times, <hi>an Horſe and an Aſſe, an Horſe and an Aſſe:</hi> ſome man (not I) might perhaps <note n="b" place="margin">I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to haue both more wit, and knowledge then grace to vſe them. But better is Balaams Aſſe, auoyding the angels ſtroke, and reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam himſelfe curſing Gods people.</note> ſtumble in reading, and by miſtaking and contracting of <hi>an Horſe and an Aſſe,</hi> call him haſtily, a Horſene-Aſſe.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, By <note n="c" place="margin">Craftie dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> craftily detaining from his Schollers, &amp; from the view of the world, the labours of certaine Diuines op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him and his conceits, touching the meere typicall cleanneſſe in the old Teſtament. He reproueth others for not anſwering his priuate letter, before publication of his errours: but he can ſpread his hereſie, and ſay nothing to the reaſons againſt it, though he had them many moneths before he made this anſwere vnto me. Hee may pretend
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14152:23"/> deſire to ſee his errors, and may profeſſe his willingnes to diſclaime them, but this truly ſheweth to the contrary: for he writ vnder his anſwere to thoſe Diuines, <hi>If I erre, make me to vnderſtand mine error, I loue the truth.</hi> They made a large Reioynder, and writ in the end thus: <hi>We are well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that you doe erre, God make you able to ſee it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue your ſoule from pride and obſtinacie.</hi> This their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redneſſe from their Reioynder he keepeth ſecret, and yet holdeth obſtinately his opinion, and publiſheth alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine without a confutation of what they haue ſayd. But marke his ſubſcription: <hi>If I erre,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make me to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand mine errour, I loue the truth:</hi> but he ſaith not that then he will forſake his errours: the leauing out of this might tell them his minde, and that their labour was but loſt on him, and ſo is mine; but I write not to ſatiſfie his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, wherein I leaue him, till, God remoue him.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, his iudgement in ſomethings ſo ſtrange, in ſome<note place="margin">He holds opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions ſtrange, abſurd, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſome, and Schiſmaticall many.</note> other things abſurd; in other erronions, if not heriticall, yet Schiſmaticall: which of theſe, either all or but ſome, the Reader will lay vpon his iudgement for his conceits, I doe not diuine, but how iuſtly I haue thus written, his opinions now by him holden, &amp; here ſet down doth declare. His opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are to be conſidered of, as he begun, and ſo hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on hitherto. For the orderly ſetting downe of them.</p>

For his expounding <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Speech of <hi>Naaman,</hi> ſo againſt me, he ſheweth neither feare to God-ward, nor loue to man.

But ſaith he, I did firſt publiſh his Letter; this is vntrue: he hereby would ſaue his credit, and blame mee, to keepe himſelfe from ſhame. My Anſwere to his <hi>By-matter,</hi> in his Letter, is fiue ſheets of Paper, too much here to ſet downe, but if any be deſirous to ſee it, I will not now (as afore) be

The matter of his Letter concerning his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions I did publiſh, as by them better vnderſtanding the Separatiſts errors, then before; which opinions I thought fit to make knowne, and ſo rather to obiect againſt them, for more euidence of truth, than withall to make anſwere to priuate reaſons for them, which might afterwards be diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, till the defence of them came publike, as now it is.</p>
               <p>In one place of his booke page 119 he accuſeth me of a diſgracefull and hatefull intendement towards them, in not publiſhing their opinion touching Magiſtrates, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon bluſtereth out a Proclamation of Loyaltie: ſaying, <hi>that they and others are as faithfull, as the beſt Prelate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and that the more Pope-like they are, the more trayterous they will prooue vnto the ciuill Magistrate, and if they be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, they with the Pope at the length will take vpon them: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus dedit Petro, Petrus diadema Rodolpho: and cauſe the Emperour to hold the ſtirrop,</hi> Thus can he not iuſtifie his owne innocencie herein, if ſo be he be innocent, but hee muſt needes wrongfully taxe others in a high degree of trayterous aſpirings.</p>
               <p>Sithen he hath called me to ſpeak in this matter, I confeſſe in ciuill reſpect he <note n="*" place="margin">As a Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, but what he doth now as an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt is to be in this point inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into.</note> giueth to Princes all iuſt due: but I ſay, all that he hath ſaid, giueth them no way, a cheiftie in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, as a member of the Church, &amp; therein ouer it next vnder Chriſt, which is the matter between him &amp; me: and for this, Reader, examine his 23. poſition before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and thereby iudge to whom he giueth kingly power in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall.

                     <p>

                     <p>That it is a Likelihood cannot be denied. Firſt, becauſe<note place="margin">Likely reaſons that their way is Noueltie.</note> New wayes from all Churches, are a probable coniecture
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:14152:32"/> of affected ſingularitie, &amp; alſo contempt of other Churches, and therefore likely not to be good. Secondly, becauſe the holy Scripture commendeth the good way of God, from the Antiquitie of it, to be the old way. <hi>Ier. 6. 16. Deut.</hi> 32. 7. And therefore a new courſe from all other, affords a likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood againſt it not to be the good way. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the word commendeth to vs the cuſtome of Gods Churches. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. and therefore it is a Likelihood, that a new way which ouerthrowes the Cuſtome, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth peace with all Gods Churches is not the good way. Can it be leſſe than a Likelihood to be in a new differing way from all? The <hi>Minor</hi> is graunted of them, and proued here before, and in my other Booke againſt them.

Hee is a miſerable Phyſition, that would ſucke out like corruption (if any ſuch were) from others, as he and his are infected with all, to cure themſelues. What if our Church were in Schiſme, and my ſelfe a Schiſmaticke? to finde vs out to be like himſelfe, is hee and his the leſſe ſinfull? but the follie of ſuch Reaſoning in this Doctour is before diſcouered.</p>

This co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, after we were come to yeares of diſcretion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the other Sacrament, we did renew, and ſtill ſo do, at that time, which is manifeſt from the order eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed<note place="margin">The Booke of Common prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſetteth downe an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and an Apoſtolicall proceeding to receiue the Lords Supper.</note> in the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper; wherein three things are performed. Firſt, an Exhortation is made

Secondly, the Miniſter inuiteth the repentant, whoſe properties he ſetteth downe, and how they ought to come: Namely, firſt, with true and earneſt Repentance towards God: ſecondly, with loue and Charitie towards their neighbours: thirdly, with an intent to lead a new life, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the commandements of Almightie God: &amp; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with a purpoſe from thence forth to walke in his holy wayes. Thirdly after al this, the people freely do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and do make a generall Confeſſion voluntarily, with one voyce &amp; conſent: in which, they firſt do confeſſe their ſinne: ſecondly, craue pardon: thirdly profeſſe amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a deſire to continue in well doing euer after; whence I thus Reaſon:</p>

                     <p>

Beſides this Anſwerer and his Fellow, is by one challenged for this point, and twentie Poſitions ſet downe, which are in ſome of their hands, this I auouch in my Booke; beſides Doctor <hi>Allyſons</hi> booke againſt them. To all hee anſweres, that thoſe to whom their expoſitions ſeeme ſtrange, are (ſaith hee) <hi>themſelues ſtrangers from God:</hi> Alluding to Eph. 2. 12. as it ſeemeth: whether ſo or noe, this is an accurſed proud ſpeech.

Peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Scripture is great impietie againſt God: Is this a Doctor to aske ſuch a queſtion? Secondly; he changeth in the end my poſition, which he firſt rightly ſet downe, and for which the places were brought; I ſay wee are Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">We are Gods people.</note> and I proue it: firſt, becauſe he hath giuen vs his word and wrought effectually by the ſame, and by that effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alnes of the word in conuerting, I ſay it is the voyce of the Sonne of God: for all which I quote <hi>Pſal. 147. 19. 20.

                     <p>Now he would make the Reader beleeue, that I ſay, <hi>that England hath Gods word, becauſe Iſrael had it:</hi> and for this<note place="margin">Page 157.</note> purpoſe doe bring theſe Scriptures.

It ſpeakes of the Church Tryumphant, of heauen and

Hee hath choſen vs in him, before the foundation of the world; this was ſpoken to the viſible Church: was it therefore meant of it, or rather of the Elect members ſuppoſed to be in it?

Now ſuch as truely heare and doe Gods commandements, are onely the Elect ſaith Doctor <hi>Whittakers,</hi> Lib. de Eccleſ.

                     <p>Now whether this place appertaine properly to the inuiſible Church or no, though ſpoken to the viſible in

Adde hereto, that the grace vnder the Goſpel extendeth it ſelfe as far and to as many, as Gods fauour did vnder the law. If therefore a childe was by the parents faith, in the couenant vnder the Law, much more the children of Beleeuers now vnder the Goſpel. Examples there be of whole families baptiſed, &amp; the Scriptures doe not diſallow Infants; Children of beleeuing Parents are holy by their parents Faith: yea, God hath out of the mouth of Babes and ſucklings made perfect his praiſe: <hi>Dauid</hi> hoped in God hanging vpon his mothers breſts: <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> beleeued, and leapt in his mothers wombe for ioy. If children then be holy, if they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, if leape for ioy, if laude and praiſe God, if they be in the Couenant, if God be their God, and all Hyſtories ſhew it to be the Churches practiſe to baptiſe Infants, &amp; not any mans inuentions, can M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> iuſtly condemne it? If the Scripture be ſilent in it, God alloweth and conſents vnto it, by his owne reaſon, whereby he condemneth himſelfe in that he alloweth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, he anſwereth to the <hi>Maior,</hi> to wit thus. They that<note place="margin">The Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts regard not the iudgement of any Church.</note> though they be not approued by the Reformed Churches, and haue not the truth in their iudgement: yet he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, firſt, that they may haue the truth, though no church approue of them: and ſecondly; that they may haue the allowance of Gods Churches, planted by the Apoſtles, though not the approbation of the Church now: and thus they ſooth vp themſelues with ſuppoſitions, to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then all Churches, to know more of the Apoſtolicall Churches then any, or els to haue more conſcience to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them then all: one of theſe they muſt needs imagine
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14152:43"/> to be in them, if they choſe either, it is pride and folly. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he telleth me that the Reformed Churches doe vtterly diſallow our Church, in regard (ſaith he) of the Prelacie. He may in this be anſwered, firſt, with his owne anſwere to vs, ſufficient to turne his owne weapon vpon himſelfe: but ſecondly, it is not true, he ſaith, as the Epiſtle of <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Sadeel,</hi> in the name of the whole Vniuerſitie at Geneua, manifeſtly declareth, as elſewhere is ſhewed.

                     <p>It is a ſpeciall propertie (as hath beene ſaid) of the true Churches, to haue the Spirit of diſcerning who are true Churches, who are not: the Spirituall man diſcerneth all things; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.

In <hi>Sauls</hi> time, <hi>Samuel</hi> calleth the people Gods people: 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. and yet had they grieuouſly rebelled againſt God. In <hi>Eſayes</hi> time were they called Gods people: chap. 1. 3. yet exceeding great wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe among them: <hi>Magiſtrates wicked.</hi> Chap. 1. 10. 23. and 3. 14. 15. and 5. 7. and 19. 16. and 28. 14. 15. <hi>The ſtate of the Churchill.</hi> Chap. 1. 21. 22. 29. and 2. 6. 8. &amp; 65. 11. <hi>So Teachers.</hi> Chap. 3. 12. and 14. 16. and 29. 10. <hi>Women.</hi> Chap. 3. 16. 18. 23. <hi>Rich men.</hi> Chap. 5. 8. <hi>The Chiefe.</hi> Chap. 10. 1. 2. and 36 3 And <hi>all the people in generall:</hi> Chap. 24. 5. and 25. 13. and 29. 11. 19. 21. 22. and 48. 4. 8. and 57. 3. 4. 5. and 1. 2. 6. and 3. 8. 9. and 5. 11. 19. and 28. 7. they were ſunck deepe in Rebellion: Chap. 31. 6. yet Gods Church and people; which this definition denyeth.

But what need I proue this further, <hi>that a true Church may at that very time be a true Church when in the generall eſtate of it, it is idolatrous, and therein obſtinate?</hi> ſithen M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohnſon</hi> himſelfe acknowlegeth ſo much, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">In his anſwere to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>White.</hi> Page. 15.</note> to his owne defining of a Church, which yet he would ſalue with a double anſwere: Firſt, <hi>that ſuch a Church yet may be Gods people by a former calling:</hi> from which then this followeth, that ſuch as once haue beene called, though<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohnſons</hi> words yeeld vs a proofe to be a true Church.</note> they after become Idolaters, and liue therein obſtinately, may be Gods people. If Gods act hold them in, when their owne caſts them out, what lets vs to be a true Church, ſeeing wee haue had a former calling of God, when hee brought vs from Gentiliſme, hauing caſt off Idolatry, and recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from Poperie the true word, and the true Sacraments, the Couenant of God, and the ſeales thereof, giuen in the firſt conſtituting of it? If this his anſwere be true, hee muſt acknowledge vs a true Church of God. Secondly, hee thus anſwers; that <hi>by Gods mercy to them, and in reſpect of his owne Name, which is called vpon by his Church and people, ſuch may remaine a true Church.</hi> This anſwere alſo is for vs ſtill, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee can deny vs Gods mercy, and that God reſpecteth not his name, which is here called vpon: Thus his anſwering for the corruptions in the old Church, grants vs to be a true Church by the ſame anſwere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I proue the deſcription falſe in this, that the<note place="margin">Second reaſon to proue his deſcription falſe.</note> Church by it muſt be a company called onely by the word of God, as excluding all other meanes; and yet many ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers came out of Egypt, and ioyned themſelues to Gods

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the deſcription is not true, becauſe it requireth<note place="margin">Third reaſon againſt it.</note> onely ſuch as ioyne themſelues voluntarily to profeſſe the truth: by which is ſecluded the Church of God in <hi>Ioſias</hi> time, for that <hi>Ioſias</hi> did compell many to ſerue the Lord,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> that were found in Iſrael, and yet a true Church. And thus we ſee their principall doctrine to be an vntruth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they that enter muſt hold that we here are falſe<note place="margin">Another falſe doctrine of the Brovvniſts.</note> Chriſtians, for ſo they iudge and cenſure vs; and with this condemnation they leaue vs. <hi>But they that profeſſe the true Chriſt, and his truth, and haue receiued true Baptiſme, are true Chriſtians.</hi> For ſuch be eyther true Chriſtians or no Chriſtians; no Chriſtians they be not, and therefore true Chriſtians, though in many things otherwiſe corrupted. <hi>But we doe profeſſe the true Chriſt,</hi> (euen Ieſus the Sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Iewes Meſſias,) <hi>and his truth, and haue receiued true Baptiſme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore are we true Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, I thus proue it: <hi>Saints are true Chriſtians, but we are Saints. Therefore true Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such as haue on them the outward calling of Chriſtianitie, and haue put on Chriſt, are Saints:</hi> for ſo the Corinths were called. <hi>But we haue on vs the outward calling of Chriſtianitie, and haue put on Chriſt by Baptiſme.</hi> Gal. 3. 27. <hi>And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are we Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, falſe Chriſtians are no Chriſtians, but no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are wee not, and therefore not falſe Chriſtians. A falſe Chriſt is no Chriſt indeed; ſo is a falſe Chriſtian no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian at all: A Iew and not a Iew, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 2. 28. 29. Called Iewes and are not, but of the Sinagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 9. It is not ſaid a true Iew, and a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14152:57"/> falſe, no more can it be ſaid, a Chriſtian indeed, and a falſe Chriſtian, but no Chriſtian. Thus wee ſee ſome vntruths, beſides what after ſhall be manifeſt in them to be falſhoods and errours, which thoſe that enter into the way of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, muſt of neceſſitie maintaine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the way of the Separation is not to be approued.</hi>

                     <p>My Similitude fits not, why? <hi>becauſe a man is a ſubſtance,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 136.</note> 
                        <hi>but a church conſiſts in relation to Chriſt.</hi> He ſhould haue ſaid more directly and plainely; A man is a ſubſtance, a Church is not a ſubſtance, but conſiſts of relation onely to Chriſt; ſo had the vanitie of this anſwere better appeared as eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as if hee had ſaid, a Church without a ſubſtance, a wife without a woman; for the truth is alike in both. I aske him, is not a Church a relation with ſubſtance alſo? if a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:14152:58"/> then the ſimilitude is good and fit; if not a ſubſtance, but a meere relation, without reſpect vnto the perſons and their conditions, betweene whom and Chriſt the relation ſtands; then I demand why they leaue the conſideration of the relation (which as they ſay, maketh a people the true Church and Wife of Chriſt) when they ſpeake of vs, and other Churches, and doe conſider of our perſons, that is, of our ſubſtances, and our walking in our profeſſion? The ideacal reference betweene Chriſt and a people his Church, holdeth them holy in euery mans ſight, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues conſidered many be very prophane. In the relation, they be Saints, the body of Chriſt without ſinne, in their owne perſons beholden, ſinfull. Therefore if the Church be alway in relation, and ſo euer to be conſidered without the perſons as they walke in themſelues, there is no pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, let them hold to a meere relation, and they ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for their fanaticall ſeparation, as others ſhall for their Anabaptiſticall inſpiration.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe my ſimilitude fits not his purpoſe, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">The Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife fitteth well to ſet out Chriſt &amp; his Church.</note> in another of a husband and wife: this hee holdeth a fit Similie, and ſo doe I: and becauſe he may not afterwards ſtart from it, I will ſhew that it is a moſt apt Similitude, vſed by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, to ſet out thereby Chriſt and his Church, as Husband and Wife, with the circumſtances of marriage making. Firſt, a man chooſeth a wife, and taketh liking to her, as did <hi>Sampſon:</hi> ſo doth Chriſt. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13. 18. Secondly, Parents take the woman for their ſonne, as <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Parents did: ſo God the Father giueth the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Sonne. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 37. Thirdly, the parties are betrothed as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary:</hi> ſo is Chriſt and his Church. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. And making a couenant declared by words, the man giueth to his Spouſe tokens of loue, as <hi>Iſaacks</hi> Seruant did to <hi>Rebecca:</hi> So Ieſus Chriſt giueth his word vnto his church, Sacraments as pledges of his fauour and the graces of his ſpirit, the earneſt of his loue, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 8. 14. Fourthly, the parties doe marry, and are full man and wife: ſo doth Chriſt marry his Church. <hi>Oſea.</hi> 2. 19. 20. Fiftly, they doe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14152:58"/> dwell together: ſo doth Chriſt with his Church. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6. 56. and 14. 23. <hi>Reu.</hi> 21. 2. 3. Sixtly, the husband loueth his wife, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did <hi>Rebecca;</hi> comforts her, and defendeth her: ſo doth Chriſt his Church. <hi>Eph. 5. 25. Iohn. 13. 1. Cant. 2. 6. Pſal. 110. Act. 9. 4. 5. Eph.</hi> 5. 23. Thus haue I declared the truth of the aptneſſe of this Similitude, for that it is moſt fit to ouerthrow their cauſe. If wee be the wife of Chriſt, then are wee the Church of Chriſt. But that wee are his Wife, (if any particular Church may ſo be called) it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,<note place="margin">The Church of England the Wife of Chriſt, as well as any other particular Church.</note> becauſe hee hath <hi>betroathed</hi> vs vnto him, by giuing vs <hi>his Word, his Sacraments,</hi> and hath beſtowed the <hi>graces of his Spirit</hi> vpon this Church, and in other things hath ſhewed himſelfe a husband vnto vs, in <hi>dwelling among vs,</hi> and <hi>mercifully defending vs,</hi> as hee did his people Iſrael: if any deny theſe things, the ſpirit of madneſſe is vpon them, and they are depriued of ſenſible apprehenſion.

                        <hi>Anſw. Falſe,</hi> is taken two wayes: firſt, for deceitfull, or fraudulent, or lying, or corrupt: ſecondly, for the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit of a thing, not the thing, but onely in ſemblance like it. In the former ſenſe, a wife wickedly diſpoſed may be called a falſe wife, but yet is ſhee a wife, and truely and rightly as a woman a wife well diſpoſed: as in this ſenſe may a Church be called a falſe church, and yet be a church of God. In the latter ſenſe a woman ſeeming to be marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet by reaſon of immoueable impediments not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marryed, cannot be called a falſe wife; but indeed, <hi>is all one with no wife:</hi> for in this ſenſe a falſe wife and no wife is all one. A woman that is a wife, is not a falſe wife, in this ſenſe, how diſorderly ſoeuer ſhe be, but is a true wife, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly liuing. When I ſay a <hi>true</hi> wife, I meane only a woman that is indeed a wife in lawfull marriage, &amp; a falſe wife is the counterfeit woman not marryed lawfully, but going vnder the name of one lawfully married as a true man in this ſenſe is one verily that is a man, hauing the liuely eſſentiall parts &amp; properties of a man: a falſe man is one but in ſemblance like a man, a portraiture of a man; yet indeed is no man.</p>
                     <p>Thus may we learne what to thinke of a Church, when it is called a falſe church: corruptions in the firſt ſenſe maketh it a falſe church but cannot make it no Church. But an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,<note place="margin">We muſt note the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of a falſe church and no church.</note> in the latter ſenſe, called a falſe church, is all one with no Church. This diſtinction muſt be diligently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, to ouerthrow their condemning of vs to be a falſe
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14152:60"/> church. If they vnderſtand it in the firſt ſenſe, yet are wee then neuertheleſſe a Church of Chriſt, for all the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they falſly lay to our charge, and can neuer proue ſuch corruptions to make an nullitie of a Church. If they hold our Church a falſe Church, in the latter ſenſe, then muſt they prooue our Church, to be no Church of Chriſt at all. For in this ſenſe can wee call a Church of Chriſt no more a falſe Church, then a woman marryed law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and liuing honeſtly no wife.</p>
                     <p>The word, Church, (as is well knowne) is vſed for the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly<note place="margin">How the word Church, is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</note> of wicked, called the malignant church; this how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it is called and ſhewes it ſelfe, is a counterfeit, a falſe church, that is, it is no Church of Chriſt, but the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Sathan, as it is tearmed by the holy Ghoſt, in <hi>Reu.</hi> 3. 9. The word, Church, is alſo taken for ſuch as profeſſe Ieſus Chriſt, which in the firſt ſenſe by corruptions may be called a falſe church, but not ſo in the latter ſenſe: for a true Church, that is, a Church of Chriſt indeed, can be no more a counterfeit, that is, no Church of Chriſt, then true Chriſt may be tearmed a falſe Chriſt. A true Chriſtian is the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profeſſour, one ſo indeed, like <hi>Nathaniel</hi> before God, as he ſhewes himſelfe to be before men; the falſe Chriſtian is the Hypocrite who reſembleth the true Chriſtian before men, (for before God there are none ſuch) but indeed is no Chriſtian at all before God, but a very diuell; as <hi>Iudas</hi> was, before he was reuealed to man, as Chriſt called him. To<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9.</note> conclude this, <hi>The Church</hi> (ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth) ſtands in relation to Chriſt.</hi> Then, ſay I, that which hath right refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Chriſt is true, as he is true; as hee is verily Chriſt, ſo is that Aſſembly which hath true relation to him veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Church. And if wee doe call it a Church, and dare not call it the Church of Chriſt, but a falſe Church, then we ſpeaking plainly, wee hold it no Church of Chriſt at all. As a falſe Chriſt, is not Chriſt but a diuel, ſo that Church, which is a falſe church, and cannot be called truely the Church of Chriſt, is the church of the diuell. If therefore they dare not call our Church, the Church of Chriſt, then
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:14152:60"/> let vs ſee their impudencie, if they dare call it a Church of the diuell.</p>
                     <p>In the end of this his anſwere, he teacheth three things: Firſt, that corruptions may be in true Churches, and inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth<note place="margin">Corruptions may be in a true Church.</note> 
                        <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which I confeſſe to be true; and in theſe two churches greater corruptions, then in ours, which I wiſh him ingeniouſly to confeſſe: for there was the <hi>Doctrine of Balaam, of the Nicolaitans, a woman</hi> Ieſabel, <hi>teaching and deceiuing the people,</hi> to make Idolaters and fornicatours: which doctrines our Church abhorreth. How then are we a falſe church, with leſſe corruptions, and they true, with moe and greater? Secondly, that ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions make a true Church falſe, as he calleth it: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the ſcripture alledged by him out of <hi>Re.</hi> 17. 2. &amp; 1. 8. 2. proue not his Aſſertion, but euidently ſhew the Church of <note n="*" place="margin">So it is, as it is conſidered in the Apoſtaſie and Idolatrie thereof, but not as it was or is in the Conſtitution. 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 17. 27. 28.</note> Rome to be the Synagogue of Sathan; the habitation of diuels; &amp; therefore the church of Antichriſt. Thirdly, that a church may from the firſt conſtitution, by corruptions, be a falſe church, though it imbrace much truth: his inſtance is in 2. <hi>King. 17. 27 28. &amp;c.</hi> But this church was no church of God, but a congregation of <hi>Infidels</hi> in the firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; a people brought from <hi>Babylon,</hi> from <hi>Cuthah, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, Hamath, Sepharuaim,</hi> and placed in Samaria in ſteed of Iſraelites, Gods people; they worſhipped diuels, and no Gods, <hi>Succoth-Benoth, Nergal, Aſhima, Nibhaz, Tartak, Adrammelech, Anammelech,</hi> and knew not at all <hi>the God of Iſrael,</hi> in their conſtitution; afterwards a <hi>Leuite</hi> was ſent to teach them to know and feare the God of Iſrael, as if a Chriſtian Teacher ſhould beſent now among Pagans, would yet any for that call that people from the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution a falſe church, or rather no Church of God at all?

Secondly, that <hi>this eſtate hee ſtood in to ſaluation, was inuiſible and knowne onely to himſelfe, by the inward feeling of his heart, but not viſibly to be ſo iudged by others according to the word.</hi> Here hee acknowledgeth an inward conuerſion, but not an outward.

                     <p>FIrſt, he ſaith, <hi>my accuſation is an old Popiſh cauill againſt the Proteſtants:</hi> I ſay it is no cauill, but a iuſt accuſation, for they haue ſo cenſured vs, and this ſo cenſuring, to be a ſin, is alſo prooued: againe, though Papiſts cauill like Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillers, this is no cauilling.

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:14152:64"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, He denyeth <hi>that they cenſure vs, &amp;c:</hi> If their writings, and ordinary courſe of ſpeech did not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him, his word might ſtand with thoſe that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him herein: read <hi>Barrowes</hi> workes, yea, and <hi>Greene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Gyffard,</hi> and iudge whether the perſons be cenſured or not. I nominate certaine ſpeeches, whereto hee makes no anſwere, as was meet to haue done; and not barely to denie, what by proofe is auouched.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, He accuſeth vs Miniſters <hi>of vncharitableneſſe, and our Church of innumerable abhominations and Idolatries, which doe abound:</hi> but the beſt is, he names not one. Firſt, this mans reaſoning ſtill is thus: They are not vncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe we are ſo; els why anſwers he thus? Is it not to remoue the cenſure of vncharitableneſſe from them, which is the matter layed to their charge? Secondly, If any of vs vſe reproachfull ſpeeches, I confeſſe it is a fault, as alſo to giue any tearmes to men in hate, choler, malice, &amp; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, otherwiſe then in loue, by thoſe tearmes to diſcouer their ſinne, as the Holy men in Scripture haue done: men by priuate paſſion, in priuate conference may ſlip in words, which is not good, and wee ought all to be farre from the ſame; but be it much more farre from vs in publike, and in handling Gods cauſe, in ſpeaking from God to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo alſo in writing: for that is deliberately to ſinne, to ſee it before hand, and yet to let it paſſe, and with will to do wickedly: oh, that all of <hi>Barrowes</hi> veine would ſee this, and conſider. Thirdly, for the ſentence of ſome Miniſters, (which he ſo much excepteth againſt) who ſay, <hi>That ſuch</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page of my former Booke 163.</note> 
                        <hi>as ſeparate themſelues wittingly &amp; continually from the church of England, cut themſelues off from Chriſt:</hi> he applyeth this to themſelues, which the Miniſters ſpoke in generall: but as he will needs take it, let him hold it as a iuſt ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelues. The iudgement of theſe Miniſters is<note place="margin">Such as doe forſake the true Church of Chriſt, doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Chriſt himſelfe.</note> iuſt vpon this ground held, <hi>that our Church is a true Church of Chriſt.</hi> If the true Church be the body of Chriſt, do they not in forſaking the body forſake Chriſt? And albeit a particular Church be but a member of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:14152:64"/> whole, yet the caſe is all one. A finger forſaking the hand, therein forſakes the communion with all the reſt of the members, and of the whole bodie, and ſo alſo with the head of that bodie. If this be not ſo, then, why is a man (in their iudgement) iuſtly excommunicated, held to be one caſt out to Sathan, a Heathen, and a Publican, as one not of the Church of God, though he be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by one particular true Church? If then our Church be a true Church of Chriſt, as is in this Booke prooued, theſe <hi>Separatiſts</hi> haue cut off themſelues from Chriſt, and are (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſaith) <hi>Excommunicatours of themſelues,</hi> and to be held as <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publicans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Laſtly, for his bare accuſation of vs, for innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abhominations, and abounding Idolatries; I ſay, it is as falſe, as idle; here in his owne defence, and againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, proouing ſtill his vncharitableneſſe, in thus accuſing their mother ſo falſly. But theſe ſpeeches flow not from any iuſt cauſe in vs, but from the innumerableneſſe of his imaginations againſt vs, and the abhominable ſuper-aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gaulie bitterneſſe within themſelues, from which the Lord once free them.</p>

                     <p>IT is in ſubſtance a graunt by neceſſarie conſequent vnto that which I lay to their charge, and yet would hee in words ſeeme to denie it, and ſo accuſe me for a ſlanderer. But <hi>Reader,</hi> marke what I ſay: <hi>They wiſh the word not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among vs, rather then it ſhould be preached by any of vs in the Miniſterie.</hi> I ſay not that they wiſh it ſimply, but reſpectiuely, this he yeelds vnto, by wiſhing the diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Miniſterie. The reaſon by which he would denie, what I lay to their charge is, becauſe hee deſires that the <hi>Word might by the Kings commandement, or allowance, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, be preached throughout his Dominions, by men fitted thereunto.</hi> But this takes not away what I haue ſaid: for<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vntrue, and againſt himſelfe.</note> here he meanes, that the King would graunt ſome <hi>of them</hi> leaue to preach in his Dominions. But herein obſerue, what he holds partly againſt himſelfe, and partly falſe by inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. <hi>Falſly</hi> he inſinuates that the Kings Maieſtie allowes not fit men to preach the word, for if he doe, why wiſheth
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14152:66"/> he it, as if it were not? <hi>Againſt himſelfe,</hi> becauſe hee here grants, that if the King command or allow fit men, they are to be heard: but ſuch haue we, and allowed by his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties authoritie, and therefore are ſuch among vs to be heard.

                     <p>The reſt of his anſwere alſo in ſome things is ſtill partly againſt himſelfe, partly bare affirmations in vntruths. <hi>Againſt himſelfe,</hi> for that hee acknowledgeth: firſt, that <hi>the word may be preached without a true Conſtitution:</hi> then ſay I, may it <hi>be heard,</hi> where there is no true Conſtitution, <hi>Ergo,</hi> now among vs, though we had no true Conſtitution.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they are gathered into Order, as was the Common
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14152:72"/> wealth of Iſrael, for in that policie, perſons were gathered into Families; Families brought into Cities; Cities vnited into Tribes; and Tribes ſubiect all vnder one Supreame power; vnder whom were others, both in the Church &amp; in the Common wealth in this order alſo of Superioritie, one ouer, and an other vnder an other; the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, being one commixt bodie in policie, vnder one King; ſo as the offices of the ſeuerall members might be diſtinguiſhed in their ſpeciall ends, and manner of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but not be diuided bodies altogether one from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in matter of Gouernment, in which the high Prieſt<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> did intermeddle about ciuill affaires, as well as others, not Church-men, as wee ſay.

Hath a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man more libertie for to meddle in matters of the firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than a Miniſter to haue to do in matters of the ſecond, being called thereunto? Is matters betweene man and man any thing but righteouſneſſe? and is not a Miniſter to teach that? and if he ought to teach it, may he not ſee the ſame put in execution, euen by authoritie giuen vnto him? an Elder, that is, a Church man, a Miniſter, is commended for ruling well, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. beſides his labour in the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

If ſo; it hath a true Conſtitution by true Baptiſme in their children, who are Chriſts thereby, as the children of the Iſraelites were the Lords by Circumciſion, till by education they be made Antichriſtian, and by that offered vp to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, as the children of the Iſraelites became <hi>Molochs,</hi> by the Fathers offering of them vp vnto him, as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſpeaketh.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly,</hi> if that Church need onely a Reformation, then it hath not made a nullitie of Religion, and ſo hath not loſt the firſt Apoſtolicall conſtitution totally, but it needeth onely reformation, which euer preſuppoſeth truths held which are ſufficient to iudge men to be Chriſtians, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions being taken away. There is required eyther onely
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14152:75"/> a reformation, or a new plantation; but not this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore onely the other; for ſo wee and all other Chriſtian Churches which are come out of Babilon, doe hold it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that wee are reformed from her corruptions, and do not need any primarie couenanting or Baptiſing as in the firſt Planting; which would follow, if wee needed more then a reformation. This Romiſh Church muſt be dealt with onely as the Church of God was in Iudah: It fell of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to groſſe and Heatheniſh Idolatrie, and ſo brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true Conſtitution an Heatheniſh worſhip; of which, when God raiſed vp good Kings, they were reformed, which was thus: Firſt, what good the Church held in her fall, that was retained, as being of the true conſtitution: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what euils were brought in vpon the Conſtitution were remoued and caſt out: Thirdly, the good things, which for theſe euils brought in, were eyther laid aſide, or caſt out, the ſame were againe brought in, and vſed as at the firſt. Theſe things are apparant in the dayes of the good Kings of Iudah, when Religion was reformed, eſpecially in the dayes of <hi>Hezechias</hi> and <hi>Ioſias. 2. Chron.</hi> 29. &amp; 30. &amp; 34. &amp; 35. And thus was the Church reformed, and not newly againe conſtituted, for that they held the conſtitution in ſome ſort, by a profeſſion of truths, and by Circumciſion, although Idolatrie was committed of them: So is it with the Romiſh Church, which ſtandeth in a true Conſtitution by profeſſion of very many maine truths, which are truely of the Apoſtolicall conſtitution, as alſo by Baptiſme, which we doe hold true in the ſubſtance, which if they doe retaine, and therein agree with vs, laying aſide their gloſſes and corruptions, euen their Antichriſtian abhominations, and bringing in what good things they haue laid aſide, what doth let, but that by ſuch a reformation, wee may iudge them a true Church, as now iuſtly we doe condemne them for Antichriſtian, not in reſpect of their Conſtitution, but in reſpect of their abhominations, brought vpon the conſtitution, and of the good things caſt out by them? for which Antichriſtianiſme wee doe ſeparate our ſelues from
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14152:76"/> them, as others may in the like caſe. And thus by theſe ſixe reaſons haue I proued, that our Church is truely Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>

Hee ſpeakes therefore <hi>improperly</hi> of vs, if not <hi>abſurdly,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if hee vnderſtand the ſpeech of <hi>the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as hee ſhould, and as I doe in this point in hand.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, his accuſation is falſe, for we make not men mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">How men be matter of the Church.</note> of the Church, as they be wicked or profane; but wee retaine them, becauſe they hold the ſame profeſſion of Chriſt with vs, though in conuerſation they doe ſwarue from it, which ill demeanour wee condemne in them, <hi>by our Profeſſion, by Lawes:</hi> and this is manifeſt <hi>by puniſhment inflicted</hi> vpon many, when they be lawfully proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and till then wee retaine them, hoping of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, his argument is of no force: what though
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14152:76"/> ſome wicked be retained? will a falſe conſtitution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon<note place="margin">Though the wicked be not caſt out, yet the conſtitution is not falſe.</note> follow? Firſt, I demaund, is an honeſt ſocietie of Tradeſmen, a falſe ſocietie, becauſe ſome be retained among them who are vnhoneſt? ſecondly, I demaund, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Corinths Church falſe, becauſe they had among them wicked men? why then did S. <hi>Paul</hi> call it a Church of Chriſt, and a company of Saints? what may alſo be ſaid of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> which ſuffred <hi>Ieſabel</hi> to teach, deceiue, and to<note place="margin">

                     <p>Fourthly, a people are matter of the Church by their<note place="margin">Outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Church.</note> profeſſion, though they erre in conuerſation; men co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenanting in word, are in bond of ſocietie, though performance faile in many things among them: Hee was a Iew that was circumciſed, whether hee was borne of a Iew or otherwiſe, howſoeuer his life was; were not <hi>Elies</hi> Sonnes. <hi>Saul, Doeg, Nabal, Ioab, Abſolom,</hi> and ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ones, <hi>Iſraelites</hi> outward by birth, by profeſſion, by circumciſion? And what hinders men borne of Chriſtian parents, profeſſing Chriſt, and baptiſed to be Chriſtians, though they be of ill conuerſation? If ſuch Iewes were not denyed to be true matter then, what lets theſe Chriſtians to be true matter now? I ſay <hi>true matter,</hi> for there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene true, good, bad, and no matter. Theſe by being ſo borne, ſo profeſſing, and baptiſed, be true matter, though not good: of this diſtinction haue I ſpoken before in my other booke. Page 112. 115. Whereto Mr. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> ſaith almoſt nothing, let him eyther anſwere now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly hereto, or elſe ceaſe to deceiue in this point.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, what is the reaſon, that a mixture of good, and<note place="margin">A mixture of good and bad in conuerſation are not falſe matter of a Church ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before God nor men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> ſome bad in a Church, ſhould more make that Church a falſe Church, then a mixture of thoughts, holy and vnholy, fleſh and ſpirit in a man, ſtriuing one againſt another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, ſhould make him a falſe Chriſtian? But as <hi>Rebecca</hi> was a true wife of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> though ſhee had two contraries, an
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14152:77"/> Elect and Reprobate within her; ſo is the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land a true wife to God; though ſhe haue within her <hi>Eſaus</hi> with <hi>Iacobs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, If wicked men intermixed make a falſe matter, it is ſo in reſpect of God, or in reſpect of men: if they ſay of God; I anſwere, <hi>firſt,</hi> that God in his word doth acknowledge the mixt Iſraelites his people, and therefore is not hee to be made Authour of this their errour. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it were ſo in reſpect of God, who ſeeth all men, as they be, then ſhould there be no true matter of a Church euer; except they will ſay, that no Hypocrites are in a Church, which though before men they be holy, yet before God they be diuels, and ſo hee holds them, as hee did <hi>Iudas,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was manifeſt to be a traitour before men. If they ſay, it is a falſe matter in reſpect of men; I anſwere, firſt, that God by his word cals not a people his Church, becauſe men ſo iudge of them, nor for any of their vpright walkings<note place="margin">

Secondly, the Prophets and Apoſtles, who were men and ſaw how it was with the Churches in their times, do not ſo iudge Churches falſe Churches before men vpon this ground. Therefore this poſition of his, is neyther true in reſpect of God, or in reſpect of man, if eyther God, or his Prophets or Apoſtles, may haue credit with them.<note place="margin">His alledged Scriptures doe not proue his poſition.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to his alledged Scriptures, I anſwere, though hee ſay, they be plaine and manifeſt for his aſſertion, yet they doe not afford him this aſſertion, <hi>that a mixt companie, is a falſe Church.</hi>

                     <p>

                           <hi>Leu.</hi> 20. 24. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> that God <hi>ſeparated them from other people.</hi> The place is miſerably wreſted from the ſenſe, and falſely applyed, for by ſeparation there is meant, a ſetting a part <hi>Abrahams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie to a ſpeciall ſeruice of God, and therein to be a people differing from all the world. And by <hi>other people,</hi> is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:14152:77"/> meant ſuch as worſhipped not the true God; what is this to vs, who worſhip Ieſus Chriſt, and are alſo a people ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from other nations, ſuch as is there vnderſtood? ſo the place maketh much for vs, and nothing to his purpoſe. Let him produce a place to proue that Iſraelites were to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from other Iſraelites for their corruptions, as falſe matter: elſe his proofe is nothing, but if hee would ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour it to deceiue others, let it be before noted, that the contrary is plaine from the word: for euen when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke from God of this their Separation from others, euen then ſpoke hee of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as a corrupt people among themſelues, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 6. 7. 8. and <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 22. 33. 35. And yet he tels not the godly of any Separation, to be a body from that mixt Aſſembly. <hi>Moſes</hi> was no Browniſt, nor any other Prophet of God, to teach this Schiſmaticall Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. God ſeparated them from Heathen, but hee ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not one part of them from another, becauſe ſome bad ones were among them. I ſeparate them from the Heathen (ſaith God) doth it therefore follow; <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſeparate one from another? from one kinde we cannot conclude an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for this is a ſpeciall ſeparation, and as it is meant, ſo is the place to be vrged, and not otherwiſe, for if it be, it is but abuſed.</p>
                     <p>

If conſcience of holy vſe of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:14152:78"/> Scripture were in them as they pretend, thus would they not make it a noſe of waxe to frame it to their vaine fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, as they here wickedly do. <hi>The ſcope with the true ſenſe, applyed to a like caſe, is a true allegation of Scripture, elſe is it but a wretched abuſe thereof.</hi>

                           <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. 8. 9. anſwered.</note> I ſee not, except againſt themſelues: for firſt, the Apoſtle went into the Iewiſh Synagogues, to condemne our ſcrupulous Separatiſts, who refuſe our Churches: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hee deſputed openly and boldly, theſe runne here into corners, or elſe voluntarily flye their Country to ſpeake and write there their pleaſures. Thirdly, the Apoſtle taught, onely the things appertaining to the kingdome of God, and no other then what before had beene taught by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Apoſtles. <hi>Acts.</hi> 26. 22. 23. when theſe teach in their particular way, their owne conceits, as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and ſhall be after further manifeſted. The ninth verſe carryes onely a ſhew as they looke vpon it: a ſhew I ſay, onely in their eyes; but not indeed ſo to any iudicious Reader. For if they alledge this to maintaine their Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from vs, then it prooues not their purpoſe, vnleſſe we grant our ſelues to be a people hardened, diſobedient, and ſpeaking euill of the way of God before the multitude, and that their way is that way of God, which is the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controuerſie. Secondly, if their way were Gods way, yet this place is not againſt all, but againſt <hi>certaine</hi> that were hardened; and therefore vnleſſe they haue ſpoken to all our Church, and diſputed with vs, and ſo haue made their way knowne to all, and that all are found hard hearted, this place helps them not. If they alledge it, to proue that in the true Church there are not a mixt people, let them draw an argument from it, and ſhew how it followes from thence. The place teacheth that the members of the true Church are to ſeparate from the obſtinate wicked, who will not be won to the Church: ſo here is of ſome true members of a true Church, departing from ſuch as be not the church, but not of members of the true church forſaking members
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14152:78"/> of the true Church, or one true Church forſaking another for ſome corruptions, and therefore it is not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. This may be retorted vpon themſelues, for theſe Browniſts ſpeake euill, yea, and with obſtinacie blaſpheme our holy exerciſes, the preaching of Chriſts word, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the holy Sacraments <hi>among vs,</hi> as I haue in my former Booke ſufficiently declared. And therefore are wee rather to flye from them, then they ſhould hence conclude to depart from all vs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fift place is</hi> Iohn. 17. 16. This is vnderſtood of the<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. 16. anſwered.</note> elect onely, ſuch as are ſo not of the world, as Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe was not of the world; the whole prayer of Chriſt teacheth this expoſition, and hee euidently ſhewes what hee meanes by <hi>ſuch as are not of the world, ſuch as</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>hee ſanctifieth;</hi> ſuch <hi>as he prayeth to the father for;</hi> ſuch <hi>as are one in the Father and in the Sonne, in whom Chriſt is, and to whom hee giues his glory, they behold it, and are where hee is, and the loue of the Father vnto Chriſt, ſhall be in them.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe words are vnderſtood onely of the Elect, that are ordained to life. Now then to vrge this place, thereby to teach ſuch a ſeparation in the viſible Church, as here is meant, is to ſeclude all reprobates, all hypocrites, out of it, and to eſtabliſh it onely of a people ordained to eternall life, which who they be, man knowes not, therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles admitted of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> of <hi>Demas,</hi> for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, not becauſe of their election, which they knew not, as appeares by the ſtory. Thus therefore is this Scripture egregiouſly abuſed being vnderſtood of the inuiſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to be applyed to the viſible members: but this is a common deceit among them, which the ſimple ſee not; but ſwallow vp euery text vnchewed, as ſeruing their turne, if it ſmell but of a ſeparation, or forſaking of the world; they neuer regarding how it is to be taken If this anſwerer ſhould childiſhly obiect that our Sauiour ſpeaketh of his Apoſtles, who were viſible members, and of ſuch alſo as were to be called by the word, which they ſhould preach, verſe 20. I anſwere hee ſpeakes of viſible members indeed,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14152:79"/> but not of all viſible members, but of the elect in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church. Theſe two differ much, ſometime, a viſible member, and one alſo Elect in the viſible Church; euen as much as a Reprobate, and one ordained to life: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the man may be ſeene, but his election cannot. So then though here Chriſt ſpeake of ſuch as be in the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, yet hee ſpeakes not of them, as they be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof before men; but as they be indued with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly graces, and holy before God, as is euident by that which is ſaid, and proued from the text.</p>
                     <p>

But this is very like the former, a flouriſh to deceiue the ſimple: and for that it is ſo much vrged by them, I will the more ſtand vpon it, to cleare the ſame from their wretched abuſe of it, in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any iudicious and learned Reader: in which let theſe things be obſerued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt, the Occaſion:</hi> The Corinthians were a people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted<note place="margin">The Occaſion.</note> to Chriſtianitie, and yet liued in ciuill ſocietie among Infidels, called Gentiles; of which ſome perhaps being their friends and kinsfolkes after the fleſh, would inuite them to their Idoll feaſts, as may ſeeme. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 27. to which ſome would goe, and eate of the things ſacrificed to Idols, euen in the Idoll Temples, as is manifeſt, by 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. 10. which ſome held as an indifferent thing, becauſe they had heard the Apoſtle teach that an Idoll was nothing. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8 4. and ſo they made no conſcience of things externall, but thought any thing lawfull therein in that reſpect. But the Apoſtle ſhewes it to be a defilement by Idolatrie, which he commands to fly from. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 14. and here dehorts from. Now the occaſion here with vs is not alike, we dwell not in ciuill ſocietie with Idolaters, but vnder a Chriſtian King, and with a people profeſſing Chriſt: here is no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Idols ſet vp, nor any feaſting in honour of them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wee are inuited. If any ſecret Idolatry be committed, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14152:79"/> any inticed thereunto, then the occaſion being the ſame, the place is of force againſt ſuch, but no defence for theſe mens Schiſme, from our publike Aſſemblies.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſcope of the 14. 15. 16. verſes</hi> is ſet<note place="margin">Scope.</note> downe in the <hi>verſe</hi> 17. that the beleeuing Corinthians pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſt, the true God, ſhould <hi>ſeparate</hi> and <hi>come out from among the Gentiles,</hi> Infidels; which ſeparation and comming out, is expounded in the words following: that is, <hi>touch no vncleane thing.</hi> By touching, is meant a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them in their euils; according to that in the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> chap. 5. 11. <hi>Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of darkeneſſe, but euen reproue them rather:</hi> theſe laſt words ſhewing what it is to haue no fellowſhip with them, it is <hi>by words</hi> to reprooue them, <hi>in iudgement</hi> to condemne them, <hi>in affections</hi> to hate them, and <hi>in conuerſation</hi> to auoid them; ſo touch we no vncleane thing.</p>
                     <p>Now here ſee this Anſwerers Scope, why hee alledgeth this place, to wit, to proue, that none of lewd conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are true matter of the viſible Church. How agrees the Apoſtles Scope, and this mans drift together? If Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt ſeparate from Gentiles, then are not men of ill conuerſation, profeſſing Ieſus Chriſt true matter of a Church: or thus; If true beleeuers muſt auoid ſinne, and euery vncleane thing, then the wicked and prophane are not of the viſible Church. What a madde Argument is this? Here is <hi>Tinterton Steeple,</hi> the cauſe of <hi>Goodin Sands.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it may be they will ſay, that Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the beleeuers to ſeparate from the wicked, is his reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them, and if all the godly would performe the Commandement, there ſhould be no wicked among them: and thus by the Lords reiection they be not, and by the godly mens obedience, they ſhould not be of the Church. I know not how poſſibly they ſhould defend this Scripture for themſelues, but thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> But hereto I anſwere; they force more from the words, then the Lord giues them, if they happily ſhould
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14152:80"/> make this Obiection: for God commands not his to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wholy from all the wicked, but from wicked Infidels, Gentiles, Idolaters, Iewes, Turks, Papiſts, the very Societies of theſe are to be left as no people of God; ſo all the Church falling into that ſtate of Infidelitie, and ſo iudged of the Church, and therefore ſuch are to be ſeparated from, and hereto tends this place: but for other wicked, which liue in the ſocietie of the godly, another courſe is to be taken; to ſeparate onely from their <hi>priuate familiaritie,</hi> and if they will not be reformed, then other courſes are to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with them, as their ſinne of obſtinacie deſerues. For theſe differing things are to be euer obſerued: firſt, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering betweene, <hi>a ſeparation publike of the godly from among ſuch as are no Church, and a priuate ſeparation of the beſt mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a true Church, from the worſt ſort in it:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wicked remaining among the godly, &amp; the godly being of the fellowſhip of the wicked;</hi> thirdly, <hi>betweene the wicked in life, holding the publike profeſſion of the Church in the Church, and wicked out of the Church, denying the Faith:</hi> fourthly, <hi>a difference betweene ſeparation in priuate from the wicked in the Church, and a ſeparation from Gods ordinances in the Church, for ſuch wicked mens ſake.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>betweene the godly ſeparating the wicked from among them, and themſelues brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſocietie with themſelues, becauſe of ſome wicked perſons.</hi> Theſe things miſtaken, Separation is diſorderly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and wickedly practiſed, and ſuch places as this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by miſalledged, to the vpholding of an vngodly Schiſme, and breach of true and lawfull peace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>The matter found fault with here,</hi> is the being<note place="margin">The matter entreated of.</note> of ſuch together one with another, as ought not to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here in one, which <hi>being together</hi> is ſet out, <hi>firſt, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> manifeſted in theſe tearmes, <hi>

Thus the Scripture records the Lords meanes vſed to recall men backe to the truth, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them in their ſtanding, that they may not fall againe. I demand, whether Religious Fathers may not force their children by threats, and correction to a religious Courſe: which if hereby they attaine vnto but in ſhew, is the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie leſſe Religious? If not, then why is a Church (leſſe a true Church) becauſe Princes, the Fathers of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; yea, nurſing Fathers to the Church, doe by their authoritie, cauſe many to ioyne vnto the Church, in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew ſubiecting themſelues to the truth? When many became Iewes for feare of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> it was noted, as a proſperous ſucceſſe befalling the Church then, rather than a diſgrace and diſparagement to it, as Browniſts now take it.</p>
                     <p>The authoritie of Princes is great in theſe things, when God beſtowes them vpon the Church; and it hath pleaſed him to vſe them, as great inſtruments for his Churches good, which here to declare how, I thinke it not amiſſe, both to magnifie their power herein, to free it from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and to ſhew that by Princes power vſed for to bring men to Religion, the Church is more honourable, and not leſſe true, as theſe Separatiſts doe dreame. 1. <hi>Hee</hi>

King. 2. 35. 6. <hi>Hee makes Princes and Nobles the deliuerers of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Guides and Defenders of them; as the Iudges, <hi>Ioſua, Gideon, Ehud, Othniel, Sampſon:</hi> yea, <hi>Cyrus</hi> though an Heathen, <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah. 7. The holy Ghoſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines,</hi> as the greateſt want in the Church, <hi>that a King was not in Iſrael</hi> to bridlemen, to keepe them in order; ſo great a good is ſuch authoritie to the Church, both to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good, and to preuent miſchiefe, if it pleaſe God to bleſſe his people with godly Princes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is ſtrange, that theſe men ſhould ſo diſanull<note place="margin">Princes care for the Church bettereth the eſtate of it, and makes it not worſe.</note> a Church, becauſe Princely authoritie bindes many to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, who otherwiſe would breake out; ſithen God hath ſo imployed them in Church affaires, hath ſo proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered them, and commended their endeuours to compell men to Religion. They ought to pull downe Idolatrie; they may reſtraine men from a falſe worſhip, and puniſh ſuch as therein tranſgreſſe: if ſo, then let this Anſwerer tell mee, why their authoritie ſtretcheth not as well to force men to the true worſhip, ſithen <hi>Ioſias</hi> zeale is herein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended? Indeed, Faith cannot be compelled, but yet mens bodies may be brought vnder; and vnto the outward meanes: by which though ſuch benefit nothing towards God, yet is the act of Princes herein laudable, and to the Church very profitable: if ſo, then the people obeying by conſtraint, make the Church nothing leſſe true; for if it were ſo, the actions of Religious Kings ſhould not be allowed of God, and ſo praiſed in Scripture, for the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the other godly Princes now. Laſtly, let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſhew, why people compelled by Princes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſhould be therefore the more falſe matter of a Church, then ſome of their Company held in through feare of their cenſures, to abide with them? can it be worſe to compell men in the time of Reformation, then to hold men in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Reformation?</p>

                     <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>it is not found in all the new Teſtament.</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere;<note place="margin">How the old Teſtament may warrant the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a church eſtabliſhed in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</note> firſt, it is enough, if it be found in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not condemned in the new, nor any order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed abſolutely by precepts and rules to tye men to one, and ſo to exclude all other, without variation of any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of place, or perſon at any time; which to proue, I ſuppoſe paſſeth all his, and all his companies cunning. <hi>If then there be no binding Law, there is no tranſgreſſion: Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Rules are for things indifferent, they guide, but impoſe no particulars to a perpetuitie.

Secondly, if this reaſon of his be good, then it followes, that<note place="margin">His reaſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowes their manner of making Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> among them is no true Miniſter made according to the Law of the new Teſtament; becauſe it is not there found, <hi>that any, but ſuch were Miniſters, as Apoſtles, and others, euer made Miniſters,</hi> which Apoſtles, or Euangeliſts, or the Elderſhip onely, laid hands on ſuch as were made Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſo they were publike perſons; and this is the conſtant order of making Miniſters, by ſuch in the new Teſtament, and no one inſtance can be giuen of any called and orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a Paſtours Office by a company of priuate men, as they be; and therefore their courſe not being according to the conſtant and perpetuall order of the new Teſtament, without alteration in this point, it is diſallowed, and they no Miniſters by his owne argument. Let him herein an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me to euery reaſon as I doe him, and if hee preuaile by a lawful fight with the weapon of Gods word, I yeeld him the victory, and let him hold it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>becauſe this order was receiued from the Church of Rome.</hi> I anſwere; firſt, that the argument is not good; becauſe wee haue it from Rome, <hi>ergo,</hi> it is to be diſallowed: this can hee not maintaine; It is not materiall whence order is, ſo it be good. Secondly, this order one ouer another,

Secondly he askes a queſtion; a falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution being ſet vp inſtead of the true conſtitution, what is it better then a very Idol? I anſwer that firſt, his ground is
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14152:85"/> weake, for our Churches Conſtitution is not falſe; ſee what is aforeſaid for this. Secondly, I ſay, that an Idoll is falſely defined by the terme <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> without warrant of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in my former booke I auouch, which he hath not refuted, nor giuen yet thereto any reaſon to the contrary. Thirdly, I ſay, that hee himſelfe, it ſeemes, dare not call it an Idoll, but demands of others what it is, and ſaith, <hi>what is it better</hi> then an Idoll? hee durſt not ſay; what is it but an Idoll? Well then, our Conſtitution is no Idoll at all, for ought this man hath ſaid, but this their errour remaineth vpon them. Hee calles me in the end of his anſwere a vaine man; but Vanitie it ſelfe is vpon him, as his Anſwere ſhewes, which the Lord remoue from him: this is my recompence for his railing.</p>

Secondly, <hi>that it is greater and more abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>then any Idoll that can be in a true Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the firſt, he tels vs; firſt, what is a falſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, a mixt company, becauſe it is a falſe matter, and ſo a falſe Conſtitution; this hee proues not, but ſets out his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious thought, by a beaſtly Similitude of a <hi>Horſe</hi> and an <hi>Aſſe</hi> engendring, bringing out a third thing, a <hi>Mule:</hi> ſo good and bad conioyned, produce a third thing, that is, (ſaith he) a falſe Church. I anſwer; firſt, that a mixt company is no falſe matter, as is before ſhewed: ſecondly, he ſpeaketh onely of the matter, and omitteth the forme, which alſo is in the making of a conſtitution: thirdly, hee proues no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by a Similie, much leſſe by this filthy one: fourthly,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14152:85"/> his ſimilie ouerthrowes himſelfe; for a true Horſe and a true Aſſe doe produce a true creature, though not like ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not a falſe one. Againe, good and bad men are not ſubſtantially intermingled, as the ſeede of an Horſe and an Aſſe, to bring out of themſelues a third creature: if they doe, that, ſo brought out is a true creature, and cannot be called a falſe one: and if the qualities be noted, good and bad in one third, the ſame third cannot be called good, nor bad; but good bad, or bad good; becauſe it conſiſts<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> doth put a beaſtly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſme.</note> by mixture of both: but thus much, and two much of a beaſtly ſimilie; wherein hee compareth the godly, eyther to an Horſe, or to an Aſſe, but vs all to Mules. And for the holineſſe of this Similie, it is alſo in his Catechiſme, to be learned belike as one of his principles of Deuilitie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee proceeds to proue a falſe Conſtitution<note place="margin">Page 9.</note> an Idol: firſt, hee ſaith <hi>it is Idolatry,</hi> and againſt the ſecond Commandement. What then M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith,</hi> is it an Idoll? Is Idolatry an Idoll? you miſerably are deceiued, and would deceiue. But a mixt aſſembly, is neyther Idolatrie, nor an Idoll, nor condemned in the ſecond Commandement: for no word condemneth ſuch a companie for Idolatrie, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they be not Idolaters. Secondly, hee would ſeeme to haue the Scripture for him, and his firſt place is, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Firſt Scripture. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16.</note> 6. 16. of which much is ſaid before: his reaſon is fetched from theſe words: <hi>what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> Hee elſe were is full of his Sillogiſmes, ſo fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as they be, but here he is onely in expoſition, becauſe elſe his abſurditie would more haue appeared. <hi>Gods true Church is his Temple:</hi> Ergo, <hi>a falſe Church an Idoll, for here</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they be oppoſite.</hi> I anſwere, firſt, if any ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition be, it is betweene the Temple of God, that is, the true Church, and the Temple of Idols, for hee ſpeakes fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratiuely, and puts Idols, for a people worſhipping Idols. Secondly, if this expoſition be true, that a company mixed be an Idoll, who are the Idolaters? This is ridiculous foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie. Thirdly, I anſwere, that the holy Ghoſt intendeth not to ſet out an expoſition of a true and falſe Church, but
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14152:86"/> rather a Church and no Church; the beleeuing Chriſtians, and Heatheniſh Idolaters: which is the true ſenſe of this place. Fourthly; if there be an oppoſition, it is betweene God and Idols; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, you Corinthians are ſuch as worſhip the true God, and among whom he will be, as in a Temple, therefore yee cannot giue worſhip and honour to Idols; ſo contrary is God and Idols, as if indeed you be the Lords people, you cannot agree with them: for the godly hate Idols, as vtterly againſt the honour of the true God, whom they doe worſhip. Thus his falſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition being ouerthrowne, whereupon his argument doth ſtand, his ridiculous reaſon fals alſo to the ground.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Scripture is, 1. <hi>Iohn. 5. 21. Babes keepe your</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>ſelues from Idols.</hi> Here firſt (he ſaith) <hi>Antichriſtian Idolatrie is eſpecially meant:</hi> but this is moſt falſe; hee onely ſaith, it is enough for mee to deny it: but who knowes not that <hi>Iohn</hi> writ to the faithfull dwelling among Idolatrous Heathen? which Idolatrie is chiefely here meant, and ſo being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, may be applyed againſt Idolatries of all times. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee ſaith, <hi>Antichriſtian Idolatrie is meanes inuented to worſhip the true God in or by:</hi> but this is another falſhood, if hee meane that it ſtands <hi>onely</hi> in ſuch meanes: for Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt with his, doe worſhip Angels, Saints, and the breaden Idoll to be very God: and if he meane not <hi>onely,</hi> then hee defines his Antichriſtian Idolatry falſely: thus two errours appeare in his expoſition, for vſually, what elſe are his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed gloſſes but peruerſion of Scripture, and falſe interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But how proues hee from this place, our Churches Conſtitution a reall Idoll? Euen as hee falſely expounds, ſo hee ridiculouſly proues it thus: <hi>Whatſoeuer meanes is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed out a mans braine, and vſed as a meanes to honour God in or by, is an Idoll. A deuiſed Conſtitution is of that nature:</hi> Ergo, <hi>an Idoll.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I anſwer, firſt, that it is no argument; his third tearme is the ſame with the firſt tearme in the queſtion. His poſition is; <hi>A deuiſed conſtitution is an Idoll:</hi> and his reaſon to proue it, is; <hi>Whatſoeuer is deuiſed,</hi> which is thus much, <hi>whatſoeuer
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14152:86"/> is deuiſed, &amp;c. is an Idoll, but a deuiſed conſtitution is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed:</hi> Ergo, <hi>an Idoll.</hi> Hee befooles his Schollers, with his<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſieth his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Sophiſtrie. <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 17.</note> childiſh Sophiſtrie. Secondly, I deny his <hi>maior</hi> as an Elench of a falſe deſcription of an Idoll. Hee proues it not, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amplifieth it, from a falſe Miniſter called an Idoll, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 17. where hee vſeth another deceit; for <hi>Zacharie</hi> meanes not that ſuch a one is an Idoll; but ſpeaketh by way of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, that he is <hi>as</hi> an Idoll. In calling a deuiſed Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution an Idoll, this man meanes ſimply, and the Scripture is vnderſtood comparatiuely: ſo hee doth reaſon <hi>a dicto ſimpliciter, ad dictum ſecundum quid.</hi> Thirdly, I alſo deny the <hi>Minor,</hi> as hee vnderſtands a <hi>conſtitution deuiſed,</hi> to wit, that it is a mixt company; for it is not a deuiſe of a mans braine, as before is ſhewed; and let him ſhew, what hee meanes by worſhipping God <hi>in</hi> or <hi>by</hi> it. Fourthly, hee maketh a flouriſh with <hi>Col. 2. 23. Mat.</hi> 15. 9. and hence<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23.</note> makes a proofe thus, that will-worſhip, and vaine-worſhip,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9.</note> is forbidden there; and it is a tranſgreſſion of the ſecond Commandement, and therefore Idolatry, and ſo the church wherein it is offred is an Idoll. So then hee thus reaſons; in what Church vaine-worſhip is that Church is an Idoll. Not all his deceiuableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe, nor all Sathans Sophiſtrie can euer proue this. Hee ſaith, that hee is blind-fold that ſeeth not theſe things manifeſt, ſo ſay I, but to wit, manifeſt folly in him, and manifeſt falſhood in the things.</p>
                     <p>In Page 11. and 12. hee diſcourſeth faire in ſhew, but partly without truth, partly ridiculous, but wholy full of deceit; as may appeare by what is ſaid, and the things themſelues conſidered of a wiſe Reader will ſhew: I<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument full of folly and alſo falſhood.</note> come therefore to his other Sillogiſme. <hi>That which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a true Church, is an Idoll: But a falſe conſtituted church is contrary to a truely conſtituted Church:</hi> Ergo, <hi>a falſe conſtituted church is an Idoll.</hi> I anſwere, <hi>firſt,</hi> that the propoſition is a fallacie of a falſe deſcription of an Idoll, as is before in the former Argument declared, ſo the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is falſely conſtituted: which ſtands in need of proofe.</p>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:14152:87"/>
                     <p>Againe, it is full of abſurditie; if euery thing contrary to a true Church be an Idoll, then euery vngodly man, that liues diſorderly, contrary to the holy orders of the Church, is an Idoll. Who worſhips his Idoll? who doe hold in him a diuine power, as Idolaters hold in Idols? An Aſſembly of Iewes or Turkes, is contrary to the true Church, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime Chriſtianitie, is ſuch a Company an Idoll? Where euer, eyther in Scripture, or other writings, is a company of men knit in one, called an Idoll? Idolaters ſuch may be, but not an Idoll: they worſhip an Idoll, and if they be an Idoll alſo, then an Idoll worſhips an Idoll. Browniſts in Schiſme, and Anabaptiſts in their Hereſies are contrary to the true Church of God; therefore Idols by his reaſon, and ſuch as doe eſteeme them are Idolaters. The Churches of Aſia, were againſt the Church of Rome in the obſeruation of Eaſter, were they therefore Idols? <hi>Secondly,</hi> I anſwere to the <hi>Minor,</hi> that it hath ouer-throwne the Conſtitution of his Sillogiſme, by altering the tearme of the Propoſition, putting in for <hi>a true Church,</hi> a <hi>truely conſtituted Church,</hi> which is againſt the rules of right reaſoning: for there may be a true Church, which may not be <hi>truely</hi> conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for <hi>true</hi> reſpects the matter, but <hi>truely</hi> the manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; in which there may be ſome errour. Againe, in the tearme <hi>falſely conſtituted</hi> is an ambiguitie, it is not certaine whether he meane <hi>wholy</hi> falſe, or but in <hi>part:</hi> if he ſay <hi>wholy,</hi> then he takes it not here, as hee did before, Page 10. line. 8. for an aſſembly of vnfaithfull men, with ſome faithfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and then the queſtion is changed: if hee ſay <hi>but in part,</hi> it makes the propoſition the more abſurd, and the <hi>Minor</hi> deceitfull, which muſt onely be vnderſtood reſpectiuely. And thus his reaſon is without reaſon.</p>
                     <p>He brings in againe, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. But thereto hee hath<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.</note> his anſwere already. Yet hence he now frames an idlement, I ſhould ſay, an Argument: <hi>That which is contrary to the Temple of God, is an Idoll. But that which is contrary to the true Church, is contrary to the Temple of God; for the true Church</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the Temple of God:</hi> Ergo, <hi>that which</hi>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:14152:87"/> 
                        <hi>is contrary to the true Church is an Idoll.</hi> This ſeely ſchiſme is without a proofe, there is no <hi>tertium argumentum;</hi> for the proofe &amp; the ſubiect of the queſtion are both one; and his owne words, which he brings for the proofe of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> ſhew it, that to be contrary to the Temple of God, is to be contrary to the true Church: ſo then frame his reaſon after his owne expoſition, putting for the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> the <hi>true church,</hi> it is this: <hi>That which is contrary to the true church of God, is an</hi> Idol; <hi>but that which is contrary to the true Church, is contrary to the true Church; therefore that which is contrary to the true Church is an</hi> Idol. Hauing thus ridiculouſly reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (if I wrong him, looke vpon his ſyllogiſme, thou that haſt reaſon and iudge mee herein) hee Thraſonically with ſcorne calles vpon me, and ſaith; <hi>Now</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Bernard, <hi>with all your learning auoid this place, and I will yeeld, &amp;c.</hi> I beſeech thee Reader, now iudge betweene vs; and if I haue ſhewed him his extrem folly, to abate his pride herein, marke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he the next time ſhew himſelfe a man of his word, and yeeld vnto me. Truly God confounds the proud, whom he euer reſiſts. Not hauing done with this, he ads one reaſon more, to cloy me with; and thus he frames it: <hi>A falſe Chriſt is an Idol; a falſe church is a falſe Chriſt,</hi> Ergo, <hi>a falſe church is an Idol.</hi> Here againe is Sophiſtrie, for <hi>falſe Chriſt</hi> is taken in the <hi>Maior</hi> properly, in the <hi>Minor</hi> figuratiuely, which ought not to be in right arguing, which is euer without Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ambiguitie, &amp; variation in the three tearmes. And thus much touching his firſt poſition, that a falſe conſtitution is a reall Idol; for if it be not at all an Idol, as reaſon ſhewes, and his reaſons proue not, then it is no <hi>real politicall Idol;</hi> which is a new Idol of his diuiſing, neuer heard of before.</p>
                     <p>Touching the ſecond aſſertion, <hi>that it is a greater and a more abhominable Idol, then any Idol that poſſible can be in a true Church,</hi> Pag 14. I anſwere; firſt, that it is no Idol, he hath not yet proued it, but by ridiculous ſhewes of reaſons, and therefore his <hi>'Predicates</hi> periſh where his ſubiect vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth. Secondly, If it were an Idol, yet may a greater and a more abhominable Idol be found than it; as <hi>Moloch,</hi> which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14152:88"/> was brought into the true Church: A mixt people profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſt, doe honor to Chriſt, the better ſort truely: but <hi>Moloch</hi> is no God; it thruſts out the remembrance, the worſhip and ſeruice of the true God, and makes the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers cruell murtherers of their children, in offering them to be burnt for his honour. Is a mixt Aſſembly of Chriſtian Profeſſours, ſuch as the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, a greater and more abhominable Idol then <hi>Moloch?</hi> Hee is<note place="margin">See <hi>Zep.</hi> Page 164.</note> abhominably idle brained that dare auouch it. Thirdly, further to proue it, hee brings in another groſſe Errour; one falſe-hood to maintaine another; to wit this, for <hi>that a falſe miniſterie, worſhip, and gouernment may be in a true Church; but a true miniſterie, worſhip and gouernment cannot be in a falſe Church.</hi> Strange Paradoxes; the latter ſhould be otherwiſe then he affirmes, by the Argument of contraries, and in the firſt hee inſinuates moſt groſſely that contraries may agree, and each keepe their proper nature: that is, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, worſhip, and Gouernment falſe, in a Church that is true, and yet he denieth a true Church to be where ſome men be lewd in conuerſation: as if ſome men in priuate conuerſation wickedly behauing themſelues, did more take away the truth of a Church, then a falſe Miniſterie, falſe worſhip, and a falſe gouernment. Hee will ſay any thing, that will publiſh this for a truth, yea, and hold it as a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to defend other Errours withall.</p>

                        <hi>that all not in the way of Chriſt are without.</hi> So it is<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> dare not call their way the way of Chriſt.</note> nothing to the matter here; but hereby (marke Reader) that he ſheweth plainely, that there is a difference between <hi>their way,</hi> and the <hi>way of Chriſt,</hi> els why doth he put the <hi>way of Chriſt</hi> in ſteed of <hi>their way,</hi> and dare not hold to the words? If their way be the way of Chriſt, ſithen alſo Chriſts way, it is but one, he might haue held to the words; and if <hi>their way</hi> be not Chriſts way, as hee dare not here auouch, why is hee yet a ſeducing falſe Teacher to their way, vnder colour of the way of Chriſt? Secondly, he iuſtifies (but yet onely by his bare affirmation) the application of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures againſt vs, as a people without, till I and my brethren can proue vs a true Church: Surely then, at this preſent muſt he diſallow the application, for we are a true Church of God, as is proued, and what hee hath ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is diſproued. Thirdly, hee excepts againſt my firſt reaſon, as inſufficient to diſproue the application againſt vs;<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Whita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, de eccleſ.</hi> Page. 12.</note> my reaſon is, that the places are meant of ſuch as neuer profeſſed Chriſt at all; hee ſaith it is childiſh, and askes me why I except not againſt the holy Ghoſt, for applying
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14152:89"/> againſt the Romiſh Church, words &amp; ſpeeches meant firſt of Heatheniſh Babilon? Yea, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> muſt I needs except againſt Gods Spirit, becauſe I except againſt you? No proud conceit. I anſwere firſt, the holy Ghoſt cannot erre in expounding or in applying Scripture: but M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and all the Browniſts in the world, both may and doe erre. Secondly, the reaſon of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo doing is manifeſt, for he rightly applyeth the places lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpoken of the type, ſpiritually to the thing ſignifyed; and in ſo doing, there is both truth and ſoundneſſe, in the application, from heatheniſh Babilon, to Antichriſtian Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, the Romiſh Synagogue, it followes well; for that the Holy Ghoſt cals Rome Babylon; but what is it to vs, that are come out of Babylon? or how can that which is ſpoken againſt Heathen Idolaters, be brought againſt vs, that abhorre and flye Idolatrie both by profeſſion of Gods word in that point, and by lawes enacted againſt the ſame?</p>
                     <p>My ſecond reaſon is an vrging of them to expound the Phraſe, <hi>without,</hi> by any Scripture, and manifeſt if they can that it is ſpoken of ſuch a people as the Church of England conſiſts of: but in this was hee wholy ſilent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not able to giue ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>For my third reaſon, and the particular branches, which is this, that God witneſſeth that we are his people, by giuing vs his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. 20. by the effectuall bleſſing thereupon in bringing men from a bare profeſſion to a godly ſanctification of life: by Gods gracious protection of vs, and mercies vpon vs with fatherly chaſtiſements. To all which he anſwers; <hi>that it is but a boaſting:</hi> ſo here then he denies that God hath giuen vs his Word, that any are effectually called, or that Gods gracious protection is ouer vs. The Rauens of the wilderneſſe will picke out the eyes of all ſuch forlorne baſtardly children, as doe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie God in his ſo euident workes, and their mother to be as barren of children, and disfurniſhed, as an Harlot, of her Lords ornaments. Blame me not Reader, if I herein be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14152:90"/> ſharpe; for let the latter Scripture be conſidered, and that they hold it, as fitly alledged againſt vs, and thou wilt<note place="margin">In what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we be with God, in the iudgement of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</note> thinke that I ſay too little; the place is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 12. In which place the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> before their profeſſion and Baptiſme, that they were, 1. without <hi>Chriſt;</hi> 2. Aliens from the Common-wealth of Iſrael; 3. Strangers from the couenants of Promiſe; 4. without hope; and 5. without God in the world. If this place be aptly applyed againſt vs, as he iudgeth, then he holds vs, the Church of England, <hi>as a people out of the profeſſion of Chriſt, without Baptiſme, without Chriſt, Aliens from the people of God; Strangers from the couenants of Promiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope, without God in the world:</hi> and what then; but as Idolaters and diuels? And herein their iudgement is worſe, for that they will needs haue the holy Ghoſt to auouch thus much againſt vs, which if it were ſo, ſhould be more, then the condemnation of all men and Angels: but herein (as in many other) they wretchedly abuſe both Gods ſpirit and vs.</p>

                     <p>MAſter <hi>Smith</hi> to this firſt, anſweres two things: Firſt, <hi>That all members of a true Church are within:</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king generally, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> doth; but not particularly of the Browniſts Church, as the poſition is meant: ſo it is an anſwere, and no anſwere indeed. Secondly, Hee ſaith, that all members of a falſe Church are without: and ſo they account our Church, &amp; therefore without: But ſithen our Church is not a falſe Church, as is alreadie proued, his argument is loſt, and we are not yet without.</p>
                     <p>In Page. 23. 24. hee defends the Scriptures, as truly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt Antichriſtian Churches, which in my anſwer to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> I deny not: but it reſts for him to proue
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14152:90"/> that we be Antichriſtians, which in that ſection he doth not.</p>
                     <p>He anſweres my ſecond Reaſon, which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> durſt not meddle with, and there he will proue, as he ſaith, that the Scripture Phraſe, <hi>without,</hi> may be applyed againſt vs, and thus he proceeds.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Argument; <hi>Churches that are in condition equall</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe, for though in ſome reſpect the true church may be worſe then Pagans, yet it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that that church is without, that is, no church of God at all, for that is to be without.</note> 
                        <hi>or worſe then Aſſemblies of Pagans, are without.</hi> Reuel. 11. 2. <hi>Antichriſtian Churches are in condition equall or worſe then Aſſemblies of Pagans,</hi> Ergo, <hi>Antichriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are without.</hi> The ſecond Argument; <hi>falſe churches are without; but Antichriſtian Churches are falſe churches,</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go. The third, <hi>Dogs, Enchanters, Whoremongers, murtherers, Idolaters, &amp;c, are without. Antichriſtian churches are ſuch,</hi> Ergo.

                        <hi>The vtter court &amp;c. is without: But Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an churches are the vtter court,</hi> Ergo. The ſixt, <hi>The ſerpent and his ſeed, &amp;c, are without. Antichristian Churches are the Serpent, and his ſeed and Angels,</hi> Ergo.</p>
                     <p>All theſe be eaſily anſwered; not to ſpend time about the ſyllogiſmes, and the falſhood of ſome parts: I ſay, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not the queſtion. For the queſtion is, <hi>Whether we,</hi> that is, <hi>the Church of England be without.</hi> See the truth of this by my ſecond reaſon in my former booke, page 82. and by his owne words in his booke, pag. 25. line 2. Now he concludes, <hi>that Antichriſtian churches are without:</hi> if we be not Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, what is that to vs? This here he proues not, but refers the Reader to the tenth Section of his Booke; and if there hee ſay any thing, the Reader ſhall there find a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. In the meane ſpace, note here; that he takes for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the <hi>Minors</hi> of theſe ſyllogiſmes be true, as if wee were an Antichriſtian church; whereby he auoucheth al the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> or <hi>Maiors</hi> to be as true of vs: to wit; firſt, <hi>that in</hi>

                     <p>MAſter <hi>Ainſworth</hi> diſclaimeth the poſition, and ſaith,<note place="margin">Page 174.</note> that they doe hold that <hi>Saints by Calling,</hi> are the onely matter of a true viſible Church.

                        </note> to haue explained himſelfe, for if thereby he meane, that Saints by calling, may be any other people, then ſuch as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all knowne ſin openly, &amp; do all the knowne wil of God: what difference make they of their Saints <hi>by Calling,</hi> &amp; ours <hi>by profeſſion?</hi> belike they may be Saints, who forſake not all knowne ſinne, openly committed in the face of the Church, and doe not obey the knowne will of God, &amp; then, what an idle ſtirre haue they made to condemne vs for ſome of ill
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14152:91"/> conuerſation among vs? ſithen ſuch may be Saints, elſe why denyes hee this poſition? If hee meane <hi>Saints by calling,</hi> to be onely ſuch as liue vnblameably in a holy conuerſation before men, without open taint. I anſwere, that Gods viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church conſiſts not of ſuch Saints onely, but alſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, euen a mixt company.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Church is a mixt company of good in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,<note place="margin">The true Church doth conſiſt of a mixt company, and not of Saints onely outwardly holy.</note> and alſo of bad perſons in outward ſhew: this I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in my other Booke, Page 87. whereto he anſweres not a word.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe no Church of God in the old or new teſtament, after the very planting, in any ſpace of time, can be ſhewed to be ſuch: but had openly looſe of life, mixt with the reſt. Mr. <hi>Iames his Retrait</hi> proues this at large.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the Scripture defines not ſo the viſible matter of the Church, if any place ſhew it, let them the next time produce it.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe there could then be no conuerſion in the Church to Sanctification, for all keepe in the ſtate of Repentance, which is contrary to <hi>Ieremie. 23. 22. Ezech.</hi> 18. 30.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, becauſe the Apoſtle to the Corinthians had erred, in calling all Saints without exception, and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny among them had not repented of euill. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, becauſe the Iewiſh Church ſhould not haue beene Saints for that ſo many wicked liued among them, bloudy <hi>Ioab,</hi> cruell <hi>Saul,</hi> falſe Prophets, and others.</p>
                     <p>Seauenthly, becauſe this holy conuerſation, which is but one way, by which men are called Saints, condemneth all the other reſpects by which men are ſo called, and if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, they be Saints alſo, then not onely Saints by a godly life, are matter of a true Church.</p>

                     <p>MAſter <hi>Smith,</hi> hee auoucheth the expoſition, as true,<note place="margin">Page. 27. 28.</note> that a Saint is one, firſt, <hi>forſaking all knowne ſin:</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>doing all the knowne will of God:</hi> thirdly, <hi>growing in grace:</hi> and fourthly, <hi>continuing to the end.</hi> For an Hypocrite, ſaith hee, is no true member of the viſible Church; becauſe it conſiſts of an inward and outward communion. All this would hee proue by a company of quoted Scriptures: <hi>Rom. 6. 4. 5. 8. 11. 22. 1. Pet. 3. 11. 2. Pet. 3. 18. 1. Iohn 2. 19. Reuel.</hi> 3. 5. compared with <hi>Rom. 1. 7. Eph. 1. 4.

It is his manner where hee can make any open ſhew, though but Sophiſtically, to deduct reaſons from his Scriptures, but here hee but muſters them, and ſets them in battle aray, but ſhewes not how eyther they fight for them, or againſt vs; this is the tricke of the older Browniſts and onely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deceiue with ſhew of Scripture. Let any vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and indifferent Reader carry this his poſition to theſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:14152:92"/> places, to wit; <hi>That a viſible member is no Hipocrite, but a Saint, and ſuch a Saint as forſaketh all knowne ſinne, doth all the knowne will of God, groweth in grace, and continueth vnto the end,</hi> and hee ſhall ſee no truth in his allegation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.</note> ſheweth what men be, that are truely in Chriſt; and not what they be, that are in the viſible Church. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. and 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> doe ſhew what men ought to doe and be, but not what they<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</note> are. 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 19. is directly againſt him; for it ſpeakes of<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2. 19.</note> the apoſtacie of ſome viſible members, who were Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and had not theſe foure properties: and when hee ſaith, they <hi>were not of vs,</hi> hee excludes them not from being of them viſibly, but for not being of the Elect number. So the Reader may iudge of the reſt, as impertinently alledged: theſe haue I mentioned as a guide to the reſt; marke but his Poſition well, and his deceitfull abuſing the Scriptures may be ſoone perceiued.</p>
                     <p>After this hee comes to anſwere my obiections againſt his aſſertion: I ſaid, that by his defining of a Saint and a viſible member thus, as is aboue ſaid, that he defines not a viſible member, but one elect, and of the inuiſible Church. His anſwere is by a queſtion, whether I thinke one ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with the foure properties before men, are ſaued before the Lord? I anſwere directly, as hee doth will me, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue ſo, and all men are bound to thinke they are ſaued before God: and who dare thinke otherwiſe, but onely M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith?</hi> If we may not be perſwaded, that he which leaues knowne ſinne, doth Gods knowne will, walkes and growes in grace, and continues to death therein, is before God ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whom may wee not thinke to be damned? He threats to ſhew me my folly for thus thinking; but in the meane ſpace, he may be iudged worſe then madde, for his think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe, and for writing <hi>that it appeareth not to vs, what</hi> Steuen, <hi>the bleſſed Martyr was in Gods counſell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To my ſecond Reaſon drawne from the Saints of the old Teſtament, who did not anſwere to theſe foure proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; hee anſweres by a diſcourſe of the difference of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and conſtitution of the old Teſtament from the new,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:14152:93"/> onely to bleare the eyes of the ſimple. When hee cannot auoid the argument, (to wit, that <hi>Dauid, Hezechias, Aſa,</hi> and other Saints did ſinne openly, and in ſome things were not wholy reformed, (ſee my other Booke for inſtances, Page 83. 84.) and yet were true viſible matter of the Church in the old Teſtament; and therefore men not qualified like his deuiſed viſible Saints, may be now alſo true matter, and ſo his opinion groſſely erroneous,) then hee fals to ſtrange expoſitions, and vnheard of paradoxes, vttered from his owne braine, without proofe, as here Page 29. 30. hee tels vs; firſt, <hi>that the Iſraelites were a holy people literally:</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>no true holineſſe was required in that conſtitution:</hi> thirdly, <hi>that all was typicall onely, as typicall Conſtitution, Worſhip, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie, Gouernement:</hi> and fourthly, <hi>that a Saint, was a typicall Saint; an Hypocrite, a typicall Hipocrite; and a wicked man, a tipicall wicked man; ſo as there might be the Sonnes of Belial; yea, and the beſt might liue in open ſinne, and yet be Saints;</hi> to wit forſooth, <hi>typicall Saints.</hi> And his ground is his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, (he brings no Scripture for what hee thus monſtrouſly auoucheth) becauſe ſaith hee, <hi>their morall communion was onely inuiſible, and no true holineſſe required of them viſibly, and</hi>
                        <note place="margin">True holineſſe required in the old Teſtament, contrary to Mr <hi>Smiths</hi> brutiſh imagination of it.</note> 
                        <hi>none were morally polluted in their communion.</hi> All which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the manifeſt truth of God; for the couenant made between God and his people is the ground of the churches communion and fellowſhip. Now the couenant in the old Teſtament was alſo morall and ſpirituall, and true holineſſe required by it: firſt, the ſumme of it was, <hi>that God was their</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note>

Sixtly, there were promiſes made to the old Iſraelites, euen in the very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: now the apprehenſion of promiſes require faith, which is an inward grace of true holineſſe. Seuenthly, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine commanded to be taught openly to that Church, as then to be receiued, and for which the true worſhippers were commended, was part of their Couenant; but true faith was taught <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. and commended to be the grace, for which they were approued, as is manifeſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. which doctrine of faith is a doctrine of true holineſſe: ſo alſo feare and loue. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 2. 5. 6. 7. Eightly, there were Sacrifices appointed for morall tranſgreſſions, as well as for ceremoniall vncleanneſſes. <hi>Leu.</hi> 6. 6. So <hi>Aaron</hi> made often an attonement by Sacrifice, for the morall tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the people, and not onely for typicall pollutions: now theſe Sacrifices for ſuch morall offences, were of their conſtitution. Ninthly, the word ſhewes they were defiled by morall vncleanneſſe, bloudſhed defiled the Land, and they polluted it by that ſinne: <hi>Num.</hi> 35. 33. and alſo Gods name by Idolatry: <hi>Leu.</hi> 18. 21. and themſelues and the Land by morall vncleanneſſe. ver. 24. 25. Tenthly, and laſtly, there was open rebuke and threats for morall tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Tranſgreſſours were ſaid to caſt off God in ſo doing, which argues it to be a part of their viſible Couenant; yea, their typicall ſeruice was abhorred, when men ſinned morally againſt God: ſee <hi>Eſay.</hi> 1. 9. 15. and 58. 2. 10.

Away then with this dreamers Anabaptiſticall frenſie, of typicall wicked men, and typicall Hypocrites, and literall holineſſe, without true holineſſe: in which hee makes the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to delight then onely in an outward ſlaughtering of of beaſts, and the godly in thoſe dayes to be in their viſible
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14152:94"/> communion carnall, and brutiſh, contrary to the euident truth as is declared manifeſtly.</p>
                     <p>But to ſtop my mouth, that I ſhall not once mutter, as hee ſaith, (oh the admirabilitie of the man!) hee reades me as hee thinkes a riddle, to the amazement of all his intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated Diſciples, and frames his argument both againſt the truth and me thus. <hi>If in the Old Teſtament their viſible typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>

                        <hi>communion was tipically polluted by typicall and ceremonial vncleanneſſe vncleanſed: then in the new Teſtament our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall viſible communion is really polluted by morall vncleanneſſe vncleanſed;</hi> that is, <hi>ſinne vnrepented of. But in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their viſible typicall communion was typically polluted by the typicall and ceremoniall vncleanneſſe vncleanſed:</hi> Ergo. Surely, ſuch of his as were blinded with his Hereſie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his folly, were too-tooly moued with a merry conceit at this riddlement, as not to be anſwered; through the obſcure profunditie of his reaſon ouer-reaching our poore apprehenſions: which made him ſay, hee would ſtop my mouth for muttering; but let vs ſee how I can mutter againſt it. What, a <hi>Goliah?</hi> then ſee the ſtrength of a pibble ſtone in a ſling; haue at a <hi>Goliah,</hi> let him ſaue his head; for by his contrarying ſo daily himſelfe, it ſeemes his braines be already crackt. But ere I anſwere, I read him againe this riddle: <hi>If in his laſt old yeares, their Separatiſticall communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was Browniſtically polluted, by a Schiſmaticall rending of themſelues from the Church of England, for ſome ſuppoſed ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall and Antichriſtian vncleanneſſe vncleanſed: then in this his new yeare, their Anabaptiſticall Communion is Smithically polluted by their but halfe Anabaptiſtrie, new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Hereſies, euen ſpirituall and morall vncleanneſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſed,</hi> that is, <hi>their ſinne not yet repented of.

And now to his argument. His <hi>Maior</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>cannot be denyed, for it is a iuſt Analogie and proportion from the type to the truth, from
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:14152:94"/> the ſhadow to the ſubſtance.</hi> Obſerue Reader, that the proofe ſtands vpon his owne coyned Analogie and proportion, he ſaith it is ſo, but doth not proue it by any euidence of holy writ, not one ſillable brought for it. But his <hi>then</hi> followes not: for firſt, marke what he proportioneth, <hi>viſible to viſible, typicall to ſpirituall, communion to communion, typicall pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reall pollution, ceremoniall vncleanneſſe to morall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, vncleanſed to vnrepented:</hi> if this be ſo, why is not a like proportion from <hi>Circumciſion to Baptiſme,</hi> from <hi>their Order of Gouernment, to our Order?</hi> Which hee denyes; and if this Analogie cannot ſtand, neyther can his. His wit, is no more a warrant to make a proportion in ſome, then mens vnderſtanding here is to make an Analogie in other ſome. Secondly, it is vtterly falſe, that their typicall pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did repreſent any reall pollution in our Communion: for there is not taught in the new Teſtament, that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall pollution really pollutes the Communion of Saints; this Browniſticall Hereſie, and cauſe of all the Separations, ſhould haue beene proued, but is not, for indeed it cannot. If therefore there be not ſuch a pollution in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is friuolous to tell vs of a type of it in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.

                     <p>Againe, the Lord takes a people to be his, before he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them; commandements are for his people to rule them, and to cauſe them to obey, not to make them his people.

If they be thus at diſcord in their Principles, they will neuer agree in circumſtantiall points: who would ioyne to them, who neyther agree with any
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14152:100"/> other, nor yet among themſelues. I am glad that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> renounceth it as an errour, I wiſh hee ſo would doe in all the reſt, then ſhould wee ſoone agree to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee very badly inſinuates <hi>that the Proteſtants and Reformed Churches doe affirme the ruling power which is proper to Chriſt, and onely inherent in him, to be in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in the Preſbiterie:</hi> which is moſt falſe. They hold no Popelike and Antichriſtian power ouer mens conſciences, to doe as they like, without the word: but that ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall power they haue, as thereby they may rule in the Church according to Gods word, in ſetting men in order, in cauſing them to keepe it, and execute the offices, in which they be placed, in puniſhing the wicked, and in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing encouragement to ſuch as walke in Gods wayes peaceably.</p>

Fiftly, they ſay, <hi>in an article of their faith,</hi> 34. that <hi>Prophecie is a publike teaching of Gods word, according to the proportion of faith, for the edification, exhortation and comfort of the church.</hi> I would know what difference betweene this and preaching?

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14152:100"/> calling of a chriſtian, or by force of ſome ſpeciall vocation; but not by any particular function ſay they: and I ſay, not by the generall calling as they be Chriſtians; for then be they not tyed to waite the ſpeciall call of their company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that ſhews that ſuch do it not by vertue of their calling to Chriſtianitie, but by ſpeciall authoritie. Seauenthly, If they may teach, they may alſo by that very authoritie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacraments: theſe two are coupled by Chriſt, and to whom Chriſt gaue the firſt, it is euident hee granted the laſt: <hi>Mat. 28. 18.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14152:101"/> but the new Anabaptiſticall Se-baptiſt will proue an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Papiſt.

                     <p>Firſt, at the worlds beginning, God himſelfe preached vnto <hi>Adam,</hi> whom hee ordained in his place, to teach the ſucceeding age; after him God raiſed vp one after another, in order vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the perſons are recorded in Scripture. <hi>Gen. 5.

                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:14152:101"/> none allowed to ordaine a Miniſter, but a Miniſter; I meane an Eccleſiaſticall perſon, as wee for diſtinction ſake doe ſpeake: as <hi>Titus</hi> in Creta: Chap. 1. 5. and <hi>Timothie</hi> elſe where, to whom the Apoſtle ſpeakes, and in him to onely <hi>Eccleſiaſticall</hi> perſons, as a matter onely concerning them, <hi>to lay on hands. 1.

Thus wee ſee in the new Teſtament all the Apoſtles time, that the Miniſterie was by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Miniſters, as it were begetting Miniſters by ordination, and laying on of hands: let one inſtance be giuen to the contrary.</p>
                     <p> 
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, after their time the like ſucceſſion hath beene <note place="margin">Reaſon for Succeſſion.</note> kept from time to time, Biſhop after Biſhop, and Miniſters ordained by them: the Catalogue of them doe witneſſe this, and the Stories of times auouch it; on which we muſt relie, where the Scripture ceaſeth to make further relation: &amp; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially may we eaſily beleeue ſucceſſion out of mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, when wee ſee the ſame verified by Scripture, to haue beene from the worlds beginning, till Chriſt, and after, as farre as the Story of the Scripture makes mention, it alſo promiſing the ſame to the worlds end. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. And thus by plaine Hiſtoricall narration both of God and man, wee ſee a ſucceſſion of the Miniſterie, from one Miniſter to another: and not one inſtance of any made and ordained a Miniſter by the people, but when there were Church-men, as we ſpeake, to ordaine them. <hi>Mathias</hi> was not choſen, but when other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were there: <hi>Acts.</hi> 1. 15. the <hi>Deacons</hi> were not appointed, but when the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were there to ordaine them: <hi>Acts. 6. 2. 6. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when the holy Ghoſt commanded to ſeparate them, had no hands laid vpon them but when there was in the Church <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> preſent to doe it. <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 1. 2. 3. And it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, that the Churches did waite the Apoſtles comming
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:14152:102"/> to ordaine Miniſters, acknowledging thereby no ſuch power to be in themſelues. <hi>Acts.</hi> 14. 23. This I ſpeake to ſhew that Church-men euer ordained Miniſters, and not the Lay-people: <hi>Caluin</hi> in his <hi>Inſtit. lib. 4. cap. 4. ſect.</hi> 2. ſaith, that before the Papacie, there was a Biſhop in euery Citie, to whom belonged a certaine Country, which ſhould take their Prieſts from him: and if the Country were large, then were appointed Country Biſhops, Suffragans, as wee call them, to performe the office for him: by which it is euident, that the Churches held this Succeſſion, and was not Antichriſtian, howſoeuer the ſame be abuſed now by a popiſh pride and tyranny. But now to his arguments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> would refell this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Argument. If Chriſts Miniſteriall power be giuen</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>by Succeſſion to the Pope, Biſhops, or Preſbiterie primarilie, then the Miniſterie is before the Church: But the miniſterie is not before the Church:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                     <p>Here marke (Chriſtian Reader) that I haue auouched Succeſſion affirmatiuely, and my proofe is euident, euen an Hiſtoricall narration of it from time to time, and no one inſtance to the contrary: This man comes with a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory ſpeech, but giues (as was meet) no inſtance, wherin my generall aſſertion ſhould be proued vntrue, but onely frames reaſons ſophiſtically, making abſurd conſequences vpon this Antecedent. Is this a refelling of an euident ſtory of the truth? will an imagination of abſurdities ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw a true Narration? What cleare Hiſtory might not thus be ouer-throwne? But to his Argument.</p>
                     <p>The Conſequence is falſe and abſurd, the Antecedent<note place="margin">The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence falſe.</note> proues it not: for make the Conſequence the queſtion, and the Antecedent the <hi>tertium Argumentum,</hi> and frame this compound Syllogiſme Categorically, and then the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie will appeare. <hi>Whatſoeuer is by ſucceſſion, is before the Church:</hi> but <hi>the Miniſterie is by ſucceſſion:</hi> Ergo. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior</hi> is falſe in this generalitie, and as abſurd, as to ſay, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſucceſſion in Propagation, therefore <hi>Adams</hi> poſteritie may be before <hi>Adam.</hi> If the Miniſterie did at the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:14152:102"/> firſt ariſe out of the Church, and not from God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, the firſt Teacher to the Church, then had his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence beene true. His reaſon to confirme his Conſequence is a begging of the queſtion, hee maketh a Miniſterie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſts power, which is moſt falſe, for where the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie is, there is Chriſts power.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I denie, firſt, for forme, by his adding of a<note place="margin">The <hi>Minor</hi> denied.</note> ſecond tearme in the <hi>Minor,</hi> which was not in the <hi>Maior,</hi> then for the falſhood: for the Miniſterie is before the Church. It muſt be knowne that there is a two-fold raiſing<note place="margin">A two-fold rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vp of the Miniſterie.</note> vp of the Miniſterie; the <hi>firſt,</hi> by God at the firſt, to beget a Church: ſo God made <hi>Adam</hi> a Miniſter, to whom hee gaue a wife to begin the Church, and as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his Wife, ſo is the Miniſterie at the firſt before the Church, the Spouſe of Chriſt, which God winnes to him by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Ambaſſadours, who bring the word to beget the Church, the word is before it, then ſuch as bring it alſo: and it is ſaid, hee gaue ſome not onely to confirme the Church, but to <hi>gather</hi> the Saints to make a Church. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. 12. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is when the Church is once gathered, out of which the Miniſters are taken: the <hi>former</hi> is before the Church, the <hi>latter</hi> is with the Church, in reſpect of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters perſons, this or that man ordained in this or that particular Congregation, but in reſpect of their office and ordination by ſucceſſion from the firſt they be before the Church alſo: therefore his argument is nothing worth; this let him know, that ſucceſſion takes not away relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Miniſter and the Church: for hee being ſent to win people is a Miniſter to the hidden number, not yet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out, and is Gods Inſtrument to make the inuiſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers viſible to men, as farre as man can ſee them: ſo hee hath no flocke actually till then, but potentially. Yea, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſent of God, may be the Church in this reſpect, that they be Chriſtians, and ſo one edifie another, till others be added, and they be Miniſters in reſpect of an office beſtowed vpon them in their ſtate of Chriſtianitie, ſo as if there were none left in a country but Miniſters, yet there in them may
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14152:103"/> the Church be ſaid to remaine. Hence it is, that a Miniſter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtreth as a Miniſter the Lords Supper to himſelfe, as a Chriſtian, with others.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Argument. If Chriſts miniſteriall power be by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page. 42.</note> 
                        <hi>to the Pope, Biſhops or Preſbiterie, then the Miniſterie of Rome is a true Miniſterie: but this is falſe:</hi> Ergo.</p>
                     <p>I anſwere that the ſequell is very abſurd, the Antecedent<note place="margin">The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence denied.</note> proues it not. He is to know that by <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> here is meant that <hi>true</hi> ſucceſſion, which is perſonall ſucceſſion, with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in ſound doctrine: for not ordination by ſucceſſion ſerues the turne, but to be ordained to the office of true Miniſters; now the Romiſh Miniſterie is Idolatry and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and the men appointed thereto are ordained ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificying Prieſts. Neyther doth it follow, that becauſe all true Miniſters come ordinarily by ſucceſſion, therefore all that haue ſucceſſion, are true Miniſters, for there is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſucceſſion a <hi>true office</hi> and <hi>true doctrine, true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> about which Chriſts true Miniſters are exerciſed. The reſt of the Arguments are meere verball, and neuer a Conſequent proued.</p>
                     <p>His third Conſequent is, <hi>that then men are bound abſolutely to ſin, in ioyning with the ſinnes of the miniſters.</hi> This man takes a principle of Browniſme vnproued, to ouerthrow a truth, cannot a man receiue the holy things of God, but he muſt needes ſinne with others? Againe hee auoucheth, Page 76. that men were bound in the old Teſtament neceſſarily to the Kingdome, Prieſthood, and Temple for worſhip and ſeruice to God, what ſinnes ſoeuer were committed, and yet men belike did not pertake then with ohter mens ſins: why then now? are Gods Commandements and ordinances leſſe able to keepe a man pure now, then they were before?</p>
                     <p>His fourth Conſequent from ſucceſſion is, <hi>that then the Lord hath made the miniſters Lords ouer Gods Church.</hi> How followes this from ſucceſſion? May I reaſon thus, the Prieſts were by ſucceſſion: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they were Lords ouer Iſrael; who is ſo ſeely, as not to ſee, that here is no Conſequence? Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion inferres no more, then the true vſe of it may rightly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:14152:103"/> afford, if men abuſe what they haue by ſucceſſion, doth that ariſe from the thing, or the corruption of the perſon?</p>
                     <p>His fift Conſequent from ſucceſſion is, <hi>that then the Pope may excommunicate the whole Church vniuerſall, and the Biſhops their whole Dioceſſes and Prouinces:</hi> I leaue him this Conſequent to proue, for hee giues no reaſon at all of it; hee ſhall doe the Pope a great fauour to proue him to haue an vniuerſall power, by his perſonall ſucceſſion, and that by perſonall ſucceſſion he may claime Chriſts power, as hee would inferre by this his abſurde reaſoning. If Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication be a caſting of men out of the Church; how can he conclude, that ſimply by ſucceſſion a Biſhop in authoritie may caſt out all the Church? ſo then hee caſts out the Church out of the Church, or maketh a companie no Church, and ſets himſelfe without a Church, by this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel; whence we ſee, if his abſurditie were true, others more groſſe would ariſe from thence: let therefore abſurdities ouerthrow an abſurditie.</p>
                     <p>His ſixt Conſequent from ſucceſſion is, <hi>that then the office of the Deacons and widowes are loſt.</hi> He reaſons thus: if ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion be interrupted in any part, then is there no ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at all. All his skill cannot ſaue him from ſhame in ſo reaſoning, if he be not growne ſhameleſſe. But how proues hee the offices loſt? Forſooth, becauſe, ſaith hee, (Oh, profound conceit of the man Anabaptiſticall!) as <hi>a Prieſt,</hi> vnder the law, came <hi>of a Prieſt, &amp; a Leuite of a Leuite; ſo an Elder makes an Elder; a Deacon ordaines a Deacon; &amp; a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow muſt ordaine a widow;</hi> which hath not been. <hi>A Smiths forge!</hi> A Prieſt came of <hi>Leuie</hi> at the firſt; and though Elders may ordaine, may Deacons too? it is beyond his skill to proue: no place in the new Teſtament in the leaſt ſyllable affords him the leaſt conceit of it. The Apoſtles<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 6.</note> ordained Deacons; ſo to them which ſucceed in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie belongeth ordination, and the ſame is among vs hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto: but that there ſhould be impoſition of hands vpon widowes; who euer heard to this day?</p>
                     <p>His ſeauenth argument, by which he thinkes he may cry<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> ſtrongeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in his owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is yet from the que ſtion.</note>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:14152:104"/> victorie, is, <hi>That doctrine which deſtroyes it ſelfe is falſe.</hi> The <hi>doctrine of ſucceſſion deſtroyes it ſelfe: Therefore the doctrine of ſucceſſion is a falſe doctrine.</hi> My anſwere to this is, that the man here hath loſt his queſtion, for he ſhould conclude, that Chriſts power is not giuen to the principall members, this is the poſition in queſtion, and he concludes that the doctrine of ſucceſſion is a falſe doctrine. May not wee thinke that hee is wilde in wandering? wee ſee neither Religion, nor the law of right reaſoning, can keepe him within the bounds of right and truth. His propoſition he proues not, and yet <hi>determinatiuè</hi> and <hi>accidentaliter,</hi> a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may deſtroy it ſelfe and yet be a true doctrine; and ſo till he expound it, it may be denied as falſe. The Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee would proue, becauſe Election is interpoſed; by which (as he ſuppoſeth) ſucceſſion is ouer-throwne. A ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon: is there not a ſucceſſion in propagation? yet alſo an election when men choſe women to maintaine this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: the one ouerthrowes not another, but either vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds other. In the old Law was ſucceſſion, yet alſo Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as may appeare by the Law of reiection ordained, if any man were deformed, defectiue in his parts and ſo forth, ſuch were not allowed, therefore others were to be choſen in their roome; and yet the ſucceſſion good. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Act.</hi> 1.</note> ſucceeded in <hi>Iudas</hi> ſtead, and yet was hee choſen; ſo ſucceſſion was with Election. But here, as in other places, he deceiueth his affected aſſociates to his owne will, like Pythagorian Schollers, cleauing to his <hi>ipſe dixit;</hi> for hee reaſons, as if we ſpake of a ſucceſſion of perſons onely: as <hi>Eliazar</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Aaron, Phinees Eliazar, Abiſhua Phinees,</hi> as in the old Teſtament. But the ſucceſſion here meant, is of a continuance of Gods ordinance by perſons Elected thereto from time to time, being onely of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all kindred, by the faith of doctrine, by which the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is vpheld, and true ſucceſſion maintained. After theſe his Arguments, he frames obiections, but none made by mee; and therefore I leaue him as fighting with his owne ſhadow.</p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:14152:104"/>
                     <p>In the next place we come to his Arguments, ſet downe affirmatiuely from vndeniable groudns of Scripture (as he ſaith) if he may be beleeued, who neuer beleeues himſelfe, but giues himſelfe the lye in print twiſe or thriſe in one yeare.</p>
                     <p>His firſt Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 13. 20. Hence hee frames<note place="margin">Page 51. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> firſt Argument for popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. Anſwered.</note> his Argument thus: <hi>Chriſts diſciples are Chriſts Church. Chriſts ministeriall power is giuen to Chriſts Diſciples.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſts ministeriall power is giuen to his Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this Argument he doth change the copulatiue, which ought not to be in a true ſyllogiſme; but this man may as well breake the rules of Art, as the faith of Truth. Againe, he vſeth deceit in the word <hi>Diſciples,</hi> which he expounds by this Argument to be other, then Apoſtles, or ſuch as were Diſciples ſent forth to preach, when the place of <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 13. 18. is euidently againſt this. Hee cannot proue at this time any to be with him but the twelue, as may appeare by <hi>Luke.</hi> 9. 18. Neither doth the place ſay, that theſe diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are Chriſts Church, as he maketh ſhew, by quoting it for a proofe but rather the verſe 18. in that place of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> manifeſteth that Chriſt himſelfe made a difference between the diſciples in the perſon of <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; the Church: both which are there diſtinctly mentioned: at the moſt they be but part of Chriſts Church, and not the whole Church, and then ſo meant, he gaines nothing by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For the copulatiue, <hi>is giuen,</hi> it is to bee taken two waies, <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>immediately;</hi> or, <hi>ſecundarily,</hi> and <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately:</hi> if it be taken in the firſt ſenſe, and the word <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> alſo for the Apoſtles, then is it for mee, and againſt himſelfe; if in the ſecond ſenſe, and the word <hi>Diſciples</hi> taken for the whole Church, then I grant all, and yet neuer the worſe: for I confeſſe the power of Chriſt to be giuen to the Church <hi>mediately,</hi> that is, vnto others for the Churches behoofe and benefit: If he vnderſtand it to be giuen <hi>primarily</hi> to the whole multitude, I denie it, as vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, till he can proue, that by <hi>Diſciples</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 13. 20. is meant the multitude, which hee calles the Church,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14152:105"/> and not onely the Apoſtles. If he here ſay, as in an other place, that here muſt needs be meant the common Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, called the brethren, the multitude, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were neuer called Apoſtles, till after Chriſts aſcenſion: I ſhew him the contrarie out of the word in plaine tearmes, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 13. where our Sauiour called his diſciples, and of them, <hi>he choſe twelue;</hi> which alſo <hi>hee called Apoſtles,</hi> and this am I ſure, was before his Aſcenſion; and yet is not this man aſhamed to auouch the contrarie, Page 39. line 10.

What is M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> then to oppoſe all? and what leuitie is it to beleeue him before all, who aboue all is moſt vnconſtant, confidently to day auouching that for veritie which to morrow he will diſclaime, as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie?</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Scripture is <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. 20. and 16. 19.<note place="margin">Page 52. His ſecond Argument for popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</note> whence he reaſons thus: <hi>That which is giuen to two or three of Chriſts diſciples, is giuen to the bodie of the Church, though many in number.

                     <p>The <hi>Maior</hi> is deceitfull through the <hi>Homonymie,</hi> of the <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> word, <hi>Diſciples,</hi> it ſignifying either Apoſtles, or other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons beleeuers: In this <hi>Maior,</hi> it being vnderſtood of Apoſtles, then the Argument followes not, that though two or three Diſciples, Apoſtles, haue Chriſts power, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more the multitude, the bodie; for ſo two or three ſuch are not conſidered ſimply as a number of two or three, but reſpectiuely, as ſelected men to a ſpeciall calling, in which regard they haue the power of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Maior,</hi> which he makes to ſtand of an Argument, drawne from the leſſe to the more, is altogether miſtaken, and ſo his whole argument is of no force, except (as before) he can proue that two or three Diſciples, are rightly vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood two or three ordinarie Chriſtians: if it were ſo, it would follow that two or three women ſhould haue Chriſts
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:14152:105"/> power, might preach, adminiſter the Sacraments, for they are called Diſciples, <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. 30. Now this is contrary to the Apoſtles ſpeech 1. Cor. 14. and neuer heard to be practiſed in the Church of God: yea, by this, any two or three by themſelues may vſe all Chriſts power without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſo a Congregation may be as many Churches, as there be two or three perſons Diſciples, and vpon euery conceited opinion, walke, after the Anabaptiſticall faſhion, by themſelues, as goodly Churches, ſeparated ſocieties. But what greater confuſion? If here be not Babel, one ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one thing, an other an other, none agreeing; where is Babel to be found?</p>
                     <p>It may ſeeme that hee would haue <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. 20. with 16. 19. to proue, that by Diſciples is vnderſtood the brethren, the Common Chriſtians, beleeuers. For the chap. 16. I haue ſpoken of it before, which is nothing for him, no more is this 18. chap. of which alſo haue I ſpoken in my other Booke, page 94. 99. And further I here auouch that by <hi>Diſciples</hi> in the firſt verſe, is meant the twelue Apoſtles ſo called, as is ſaid, by an excellencie aboue others, as being firſt and the beſt: compare this place with <hi>Mark.</hi> 9. 35. where the Holy Ghoſt expounds what is in <hi>Mat.</hi> meant by diſciples; which Expoſition is more then all the idle words of many M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths,</hi> expounding it otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>His third Scripture is <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 16. 20. whence he doth<note place="margin">Page 53.

                           <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 23.</note> people holy, &amp; thereby to haue equall power in gouerning:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14152:106"/> theſe hee calles here Brethren, or the <hi>bodie of the Church, or Diſciples,</hi> and this hee grounds vpon <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 16. 20. But is not the man determined to ſinne wilfully, to hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke his followers, and to abuſe God himſelfe, who out of this place will hold, that the words in verſe 19. <hi>Goe and teach, &amp;c.</hi> are ſpoken to Diſciples, common Chriſtians, and not to the Apoſtles, and in them <hi>onely,</hi> to ſuch as ſucceed them in the Miniſterie; when firſt, in verſe 16. hee nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates onely the <hi>eleuen,</hi> which are called Apoſtles, Act. 1. 26. Secondly, it is the vniuerſall opinion of all the Church of God, (excepting ſuch Anabaptiſticall Schiſmatickes) that <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 16. 20. is vnderſtood of the Apoſtles and their ſucceſſours; and none take there the word <hi>Diſciples</hi> for the brethren or bodie of the Church, as this man in his impudent audaciouſneſſe doth.</p>
                     <p>Hee would proue his <hi>Minor</hi> by this reaſon, becauſe God hath promiſed his preſence to be with his Church, as hee promiſed to be with the Apoſtles to the worlds end. If this be a good reaſon, then an Infant Elect hath the power of Chriſt to preach, to baptiſe, for God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his preſence to ſuch; yea, to women: and by this, one man may be a Church in himſelfe, (as this man abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>once</hi> auouched) for God is with a good man, as well as with the Church: if the preſence of God promiſed to all his euer, may conclude to all, what is properly giuen to ſome, what might not men aſſume vnto themſelues? Truely his Arguments are childiſhly framed, his reaſons groſſely abſurde, his alledged Scriptures ſhameleſly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his audaciouſneſſe in auouching what he pleaſeth intollerable: let the Reader in Gods preſence iudge freely of what I here lay to his charge, whether I ſpeake the truth or no.</p>
                     <p>His fourth place is <hi>Marke</hi> 13. 33. 37. whence hee thus<note place="margin">Page 53. His fourth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, for Popularitie, Anſwered.</note> reaſons. <hi>Chriſts ſeruants haue Chriſts authoritie; Chriſts vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church are Chriſts ſeruants:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſts viſible church hath Chriſts authoritie.</hi> Hee expounds Chriſt viſible Church <hi>to be two or three faithfull people;</hi> which words hee
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14152:106"/> puts in his Aſſumption vnlogically, ſtill not concluding the words of the queſtion. But who ſeeth not a double ſignification to be in this word, <hi>Seruants,</hi> which ought not to be in ſound reaſoning, neither is euer, but among iang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sophiſters, and Hereticall deceiuers: Seruants, in the propoſition is to be vnderſtood, as the word <hi>ſeruant, Ro.</hi> 1. 1. for one that is ſeruant in ſpecial office, &amp; in the Aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Common Chriſtians, who be all Chriſts ſeruants. His place quoted is a ſimilie, which is not to be wreſted from the ſcope, nor the parts of the ſimilie taken beyond the intent of the place. In this place the Lord intends nor to ſet out any gouernment of the church, the ſcope is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noted in verſe 33. &amp; 35. which is this; that euery one ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imploy themſelues in what taſke the Lord hath ſet them to, watching, by well doing therein, for the comming Chriſt, to take an account of vs. What is this to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> imagination? Surely, if any thing about gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be drawne out thence, it is flat againſt himſelfe. For firſt, the <hi>Maſter</hi> is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt;</hi> then ſecondly, the <hi>houſe</hi> muſt needs be his <hi>Church;</hi> thirdly, the <hi>Seruants,</hi> the <hi>Officers;</hi> to whom it is ſaid, he giueth <hi>authoritie,</hi> not to the <hi>houſe</hi> then, but to <hi>ſeruants</hi> in the houſe, who are to looke ouer others; for to euery one hath the Lord allotted his worke: fourthly, the <hi>Porter</hi> may be Gods ſpirit, who watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Church, to preſerue it from the enemie. Thus then out of this (if it afford any thing for gouernment) it is plaine that the Church, the houſe, is gouerned by ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants (who receiue authoritie from Chriſt) but it ſelfe doth not gouerne: for ſo it ſhould be the Gouernour, and the gouerned.</p>
                     <p>His fift place is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 18. 24. with <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 35.<note place="margin">Page 54.

But the former is true;</hi> Ergo, <hi>the latter.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> is denied; for neither <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> 
                        <hi>Marie Magdalene</hi> nor <hi>Cleophas,</hi> had giuen to them Chriſts</p>

                     <p>Miniſteriall power: hee hath gotten authoritie now for <hi>women Preachers,</hi> belike to ouerthow the Apoſtles inhibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is enough to ſet downe his argument, the folly of it ſufficiently confutes it: but is his reaſon of force to make good this his madde Paradoxe? hearken to it, and conſider; for ſooth hee thinks it is iuſt ſo as hee ſaith, and why I pray you? becauſe (ſaith hee) <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Eleuen, were all together when our Sauiour gaue this power to his Diſciples mentioned in <hi>Mat. 28. 16. 20. Iohn.</hi> 20. 21. 23. and ſuch ſpeeches elſe where, as concerneth the Miniſteriall power of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>So then his reaſon ſeemes to be this: <hi>Whatſoeuer Chriſt ſpake, when all his Diſciples, men and women, Apoſtles and multitude were together, that was ioyntly alike ſpoken to all of them that ſo were then gathered together.</hi> This proofe, wants<note place="margin">Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> women Preachers.</note> a proofe, and is at no hand to be taken of his bare word: firſt, becauſe hee is ſo ſtrange a broacher of opinions, and ſo inconſtantly confident. Secondly, the argument and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are both ſo abſurd. Thirdly, becauſe this bare reaſon would vphold what is plainely forbidden by the Apoſtle, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. 35. Fourthly, for that the aſſertion vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped herewith is ſo contrary to the iudgement of all Diuines, Councels, Fathers, Churches, and practiſe of any womaniſh authoritie, in eyther preaching, or vſing the Church cenſures publikely. Fiftly, becauſe it greatly dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth the eſtimation of the holy men and women in the Apoſtles dayes, whom wee neuer read of did put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſuch authoritie, which ſurely, as they ought, had it beene impoſed vpon them, ſo would they haue at one time or other ſhewed this their equall Authoritie with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Sixtly, becauſe it is againſt that place of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> chap. 4. 8. 12. where the holy Ghoſt mentioneth how Chriſt gaue gifts <hi>vnto men,</hi> ver. 8. whom he made <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. to gather Saints, but no mention is made of <hi>gifts to women,</hi> for to preach and gather Churches.</p>

                        <hi>is giuen, vnto them the Miniſteriall power of Chriſt is giuen: But the Promiſes, the Couenant, and the bleſſing is giuen vnto the poſteritie of</hi> Abraham, <hi>according to the Faith,</hi> that is, <hi>to all the faithfull, who are indeed the true Children of</hi> Abraham: Ergo, <hi>the Miniſteriall power is giuen to the faithfull: that is, to two or three faithfull people, which are a body vnto Chriſt.</hi> This argument is diſeaſed with an <hi>Homonymie</hi> of <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> words; for <hi>Promiſes, Couenant,</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> are eyther <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> appertaining to euery Chriſtian; or <hi>ſpeciall,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne particular ſtates of men. <hi>Againe,</hi> therebe Promiſes, Couenants, and Bleſſings, onely comprehending things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, and common fauours, whereof the very Reprobates may pertake: and there be Promiſes, Couenants, and Bleſſings of internall ſpirituall graces, proper to the Elect people of God. All his Scriptures quoted doe ſpeake of theſe things eyther appertaining to all, or of ſuch as be proper to the very Elect: let the places be read and iudged of. How then followes the Concluſion hence to a ſpeciall power of gouernment appointed to ſome? By this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from theſe Scriptures, hee may as well conclude that little Infants haue the Miniſteriall power of Chriſt, ſithen the Promiſe is made to them: <hi>Acts.</hi> 2. 39. the Couenant made with them: <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 14. 15. The Bleſſing is giuen to them. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 16. I anſwere further, if this argument be now good, then was it ſo in the Law? for to all Iſrael was the Promiſe, the Couenant, and Bleſſing giuen; and therefore belike therewith the power of Iuriſdiction; but we ſee then the Church neuer tooke ſo much vpon them; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did euer any Prophet gather thence ſo much: indeed <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Corah</hi> attempted as much, but the Earth gaped with wide mouth to ſwallow vp ſo wretched a <hi>Smithean</hi> Spirit, as not worthy to liue longer on the earth. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this maketh <hi>Simon</hi> the Sadler, <hi>Tomkin</hi> the Taylor, <hi>Billy</hi> the Bellowes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, and ſuch like to command equally with Soueraigne Authoritie in Church matters, and to liue, if they liſt, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely: for it is forſooth their Chriſtian libertie to be tyed to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14152:108"/> nothing.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom Chriſt is giuen to be King, Prieſt, and Prophet directly and immediately, vnto them is Chriſts mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall power giuen.

                     </p>
                     <p>Hee hath nine arguments, and this onely is in the right <note place="margin">Anſwered.</note> forme of reaſoning, in all the other hee playeth Childiſhly the Sophiſter, and alſo in this his beſt manner wickedly a Deceiuer. The ſequell of this Argument is ſeely; hee would here inferre a Miniſteriall power, which is viſible in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall gouernment of the Church (for of this wee ſpeake, and doe wholy and euer in all this diſpute vnderſtand it, elſe hee doth ſtill play the Sophiſter,) from inward and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall pertaking of Chriſts Offices by the hand of faith, through the ſpirit. If hee thus collect a right, directly and immediately, to deſcend to euery one in outward gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they haue Chriſt their King, Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, then would it follow, that euery Chriſtian man, yea, and woman, may directly and immediately take vpon them, that which is ſo directly and immediately giuen them, euen as well, as they pertake ſo of Chriſt, and are in him Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets. If they haue the Miniſteriall power giuen, as they haue Chriſt giuen to them, then may they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume (without leaue or liking of any, when they pleaſe,) that power to themſelues, euen as without mans leaue, they take Chriſt giuen them by God the Father: what a ground-worke
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14152:108"/> is here laid of all diſorder and confuſion; yea, and of intollerable inſolencie and ſwelling pride in euery particular perſon? God is the God of order, and not of ſuch a popular proud confuſion.</p>
                     <p>Hee would proue his Conſequent from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32. The<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 32.</note> words are, <hi>He gaue him for vs all to death, how ſhall he not with him giue vs all things alſo?</hi> ſo in theſe words <hi>all things,</hi> hee includes, this and that thing, from a generall, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes any thing: why may not by his thus abſurd reaſoning any Chriſtian challenge to be a King? the vnlearned to be exquiſite in all Sciences? the poore man to be rich? for what lets vs more to vnderſtand in <hi>all things,</hi> Riches, Wiſedome, Learning, Regalitie, and what not, as well as hee to include Miniſteriall power; ſithen euery Chriſtian by hauing of Chriſt, hath as much right in theſe things, which are alſo his gifts to his Church, as in the outward gouernment of it? If hee hath giuen vs theſe things; why are not all learned? why take wee not poſſeſſion of riches where they be? and if theſe be not here meant, then <hi>all things</hi> is to be vnderſtood with a reſtraint; and ſo then it ſtands vpon an expoſition, what is meant by <hi>all things,</hi> which he yet hath not done: but till hee doe, hee may ſee his folly with impietie in ſo alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Scripture. Yet for all this, thus farre I yeeld the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent true; that Chriſts miniſteriall power is giuen for them, to whom Chriſt is giuen, in reſpect of the efficacie, alſo the free holy powerfull vſe of it; becauſe Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall power is for the Churches benefit, to rule it, and to order ſuch as be in it, and not for others to cenſure them: for the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>What haue I to doe to iudge them that</hi>

                        <hi>are without?</hi> but this is farre from the right of Authoritie, to execute that miniſteriall power which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smith</hi> pleads for.</p>
                     <p>Touching the <hi>minor,</hi> I demaund whether hee hold that Chriſt is giuen to no fewer then two or three, if hee ſay no, the whole Scripture diſclaimes his hereſie; if yea, then <hi>one</hi> hauing Chriſt giuen to him, that ſame <hi>one</hi> by his argument hath Chriſts miniſteriall power in him, and ſo Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>

The Antecedent is of a priuate remitting and retaining of iniuries; and ſo a man hath a right, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of himſelfe before men, to forgiue the wrong, as the man offending ſhall humble himſelfe, or elſe to claime his

As in his firſt Anſwere, he would type out by the Leuites, the Prieſts and Kings in the old Teſtament, the bodie of the Church in the new Teſtament; ſo as, looke as they had the gouernment then, ſo haue the people now. This his proportion ouerthrowes the Rule of Kings in Office, and makes the people a King: and if this be ſo, why then doth not the ſuperioritie of <hi>Aaron,</hi> and degrees among the Prieſts, type out ſuperioritie now?

And therfore as Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith, wee may not ſeparate for corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but muſt labour in our place to ſeeke a redreſſe of them; except the Church become no Church, full of ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Heatheniſh, or Iſraelitiſh Idolatry, as in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> time, when the Lord hath remoued his Candleſticke. But if this before ſet downe, be their iudgement indeed, then let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> tell me firſt why doe they not ſtay with vs, and ſeeke redreſſe, if any thing be amiſſe among vs; by due order, wayting the Lords leaſure in raiſing vp his owne meanes to reforme diſorders, which is the authoritie of the Magiſtrate: for this ſee the iudgement of that wiſe, holy, learned and moderate, yet truely zealous ſpirited man <hi>Zanchie,</hi> vpon <hi>Eſay</hi> 2. in his Booke <hi>De Eccleſia, page</hi> 225.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14152:114"/> not their iudgement, or elſe they practiſe contrary to their iudgement: ſo like Scribes and Phariſes, that is, Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts Hypocrites, they teach and ſay, but doe not; and are guiltie of that which they would blame in vs: And if this Poſition be true, then be they Schiſmatickes; for to breake peace with the Churches, where we may and ought to hold communion, is Schiſme: See <hi>Zanch. ibidem, Page. 119. 120. &amp;c.</hi>

And my anſwere hereto is, that hee hath affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more then hee hath proued, or can be able to proue, if ſuch a Church were as hee ſuppoſeth: but hee is herein his meere imagination; for what Church of Chriſt is ſo giuen ouer, that <hi>all</hi> euer did, or doe plead for Adulterers, Blaſphemers, and ſuch like? And I aske him what be thoſe that do call vpon the Church for iudgement, are they mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? then all the Church doth not defend the wicked man: his abſurd ſuppoſition hath in it alſo a contradiction; for hee ſuppoſeth the whole Church to plead for the wicked man, and yet ſuppoſeth alſo then there to be ſome pleading againſt the wicked man: hee cannot tell what he ſaith. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him, the next time to teach his Schollers better, to ſpeake more wiſely, and if hee can, let him ſhew firſt, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any ſuch church of God as he ſuppoſeth: for grant falſe conceits and idle ſuppoſitions, a man then may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:14152:114"/> againſt the whole. Secondly, that ſuch an Aſſembly, where one is ſo tollerated, is not the Church of God. Thirdly, that the holy things are there vnlawfully adminiſtred, ſo as the godly there who call for iuſtice muſt needes ſeparate as hee by this doctrine intendeth, then hath hee ſpoken to the purpoſe, and ſomewhat for his cauſe.

And in Page 179. hee ſaith, <hi>it is a ſinne</hi> to make a ſeparation from a Church for matters <hi>controuertible and doubtfull.</hi> And yet<note place="margin">For what &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what doe the Separatiſts moſt contend.</note> for ſuch matters doe they make ſeparation: for what and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout what doe they chiefely contend? is it not for and about matters of outward gouernement; not about the ſubſtance of things neither, but about circumſtances, more about the manner, then the matter, which maketh the controuerſie endleſſe. I deny not but the thing commaunded muſt be done, &amp; alſo muſt be well done, &amp; prudence is required to obſerue circumſtances, that good things be thereby done ſeaſonably and well, for the time, place and perſon: but this is ill, for circumſtances not obſerued exactly, to deny the truth of ſubſtances, to hold them falſe, and to iudge things done ſubſtantially, as not done; for that they be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly circumſtantiall, eſpecially where both the matter and manner of ſuch things be very controuertible, as about the circumſtances of externall gouernment and diſcipline of the Church: which herein I will make manifeſt to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of euery Chriſtian Reader, and eſpecially I intend it for this end; to ſtay the mindes of many: <hi>firſt,</hi> of young<note place="margin">A Caueat to young Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines.</note> Students in diuinitie, who in a godly zeale deſiring the glory of God in the amendment of all mens manners, are ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouer the eares, at the very firſt on-ſet, in the controuerſie of diſcipline, before they haue learned in any ſmall meaſure to ſpeake rightly of the common principles of Chriſtianitie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to ſtay the mindes of Country people in many<note place="margin">To Country people.</note>
                        <pb n="212" facs="tcp:14152:115"/> places, who ſpeake ſo certainely, ſo peremptorie of this point, as if they were the profound Doctours of Ancient times, wiſer then many of their deliberate and learned tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. Both theſe meane well, their affections are for good and againſt euill; but herein is it amiſſe, that they doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to be too ſoone ripe, aduenturing boldly to runne ere they can creepe, much leſſe goe: and all this ariſeth vpon their erroneous conceit, that theſe points of diſcipline and Church-gouernment, are ſuppoſed by them to be ſo eaſily diſcerneable, ſo apparant by ſcripture, as that ſeely men may iudge rightly wherein the truth thereof doth ſtand.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to let them ſee how farre otherwiſe it is, I will<note place="margin">It is not an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie thing for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one to iudge rightly of Church-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and diſcipline.</note> lay open the intricateneſſe hereof, by the inconſtant mindes of learned men, their varietie of opinions, ſome holding this, ſome that; euen plaine contradictories in ſomethings. What herein is the truth, and who do hold it, is not for me to determine: I leaue euery man to iudge freely, and the Lord guide him to the beſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, ſome hold no gouernment at all, which is but a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſticall conceit, yet haue they their reaſons, making a diſtinction of a double perſon in one man, a Citizen and a Chriſtian; theſe deny Eccleſiaſticall gouernment, and the Anabaptiſts Ciuill gouernment, to which they may eaſily draw ſome ſeely Browniſts, as daily they doe, and that from the force of their owne grounds: the Separatiſts hold all to be voluntary profeſſours; now voluntarineſſe is taken away by being vnder any gouernment: to be ſubiect and ruled is an eſtate farre from freedome; Chriſtians looſe thereby Chriſtian libertie. Chriſtians Saints neede no conſtraining power, they be led by the ſpirit; but what proceed I to ſpeak further of the fanaticall frenſie of theſe two generations of men: their reaſons haue beene confuted long ſince.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is held that there muſt be an externall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment<note place="margin">There muſt be a Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church.</note> and that rightly, for the well ordering of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall meanes of mens ſaluation among the profeſſours of Chriſts name, the reaſons for it are: firſt, becauſe Chriſt gaue <hi>Gouernours</hi> to his Church. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Secondly,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14152:115"/> the Apoſtle exhorted ſome to <hi>rule</hi> diligently. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 8. Thirdly, hee mentioneth ſuch as were <hi>ouer</hi> the Churches <hi>in the Lord. 1. Theſ.</hi> 5. 12. Fourthly, hee allowes to ſuch double honour, that is, reuerence and maintenance, euen for their well gouerning. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Fiftly, for that in the Scripture is a Commandement for the preaching of the word, for the adminiſtration of Sacraments, and other ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes, and all theſe to be done <hi>decently and in order: 1. Cor.</hi> 14. 40. now of neceſſitie there is required a rule and a gouernment both to ſee things and perſons orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and ſo alſo kept. Sixtly, the vntoward nature of man, which reſiſts order, and deſires to wander looſely and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, requires gouernment: without which experience tels vs, that the Church cannot remaine in ſafetie, but Sathan would intrude his inſtruments vpon the Church, and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it with falſe doctrine, rend it by Schiſme, and pollute it wholy with prophaneneſſe of mens liues. Seauenthly, the Church of Chriſt is called a kingdome: <hi>Mat. 13. 41. 2. Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. now in a kingdome is gouernment. Eightly, if no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of men can be without gouernment, neyther in king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Citie, nor Towne, then cannot the Church be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, ſo long as it conſiſts of mortall men, though neuer ſo deuout, yet alwayes herein an imperfect ſtate, and needs gouernment. Ninthly, till Chriſts time from the worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, before and in the time of the Law, was there go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment in the Church of God: and therefore are we not to thinke, that our Sauiour when he came, would make all that profeſſed him Libertines, and free from all outward gouernment. Tenthly, wee read how the Apoſtle was, euen in his time, conſtrained to vſe his power giuen him of Chriſt to rule, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and did puniſh ſome. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. Eleauenthly, the iudgement of reformed Churches mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by practiſe, all of them yeelding to gouernment. That there is gouernment is certaine, and this is alſo as certaine,<note place="margin">How Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors ought to behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</note> that Gouernours ought to <hi>rule well: 1. Tim. 5. 17. with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: Rom.</hi> 12. 8. and without pride and tiranny: 1. <hi>Pet 5. 3. Mat. 20. 25. Luke.</hi> 22. 25. 26. But in this firme and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14152:116"/> moſt certaine truth is very great vncertaintie: for though it be generally held, that there is an Eccleſiaſticall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that there is a delegate power of Ieſus Chriſt for well ordering and ruling his people, called the Church, yet herein is great controuerſie, and very hote contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe on one ſide and on an other, as men are perſwaded of a truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some hold not onely a gouernment, but alſo that in Chriſts</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Some hold it to be in the Pope with his Conſiſtory of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Papiſts.</note> but this is held the deuiſe of man, and condemned of all reformed Churches, which haue forſaken the Romiſh Synagogue, to be abhorred as vſurped authoritie, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian tyranny.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Some hold it to be in the body of the Congregation,</hi> as may<note place="margin">Anabaptiſts.</note> be ſeene here before: <hi>others flatly deny it,</hi> as a confuſed popular gouernment; all in gouernment, and ſo none go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14152:116"/> execute it; Authoritie they haue without euer abilitie to do the duties thereto belonging, but by Subſtitutes. If the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly doe any thing, that muſt be in Chriſts name; for that they haue their authoritie from Chriſt; but Miniſters muſt by this opinion, doe all in the Churches name, preach, adminiſter the Sacraments in the Churches name.

Cor.</hi> 12. 28. as degrees one ouer another. Thirdly, becauſe God himſelfe in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordained a Superioritie among Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: there were the high Prieſt, and chiefe Prieſts, and ſo forth; and this order is not forbidden in the new teſtament. Touching that place of <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 25. 26. ſee <hi>Doctor Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Doctor Doue</hi> of <hi>Church Gouernment,</hi> by whom
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14152:117"/> that text is expounded at large: If they erre, let it be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Fourthly, becauſe the ground for Superioritie is alike in the new Teſtament, as in the old; to preſerue order, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the Apoſtle commands to maintaine peace, and to preuent Schiſme, which began in the Apoſtles dayes. For theſe cauſes was the ſuperioritie among the Church-men with the Iewes, and not for to be types, though the high Prieſt did type out Chriſt, yet did not the other Prieſts ſo, in that one was ſet ouer another for good gouernment ſake. Fiftly, becauſe God hath by inſtinct of nature in all ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, moued people to approue of a Superioritie: yea, in his workes there is ſet a ſupereminencie of one creature aboue another: thus in the workmanſhip of the World, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proues it; in natures inclination he confirmes it; in the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh policie he commanded it: what makes it odious in the Chriſtian Church, ſithen it is experienced, that men now are as proud, as affectionate to ſingularitie, as opinionate to priuate courſes, as vnwilling to be in ſubiection, all which require a curbing power, as euer heretofore at any time?

Thus wee ſee the great difference among the beſt learned of all ſorts, about the perſons that ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne.</p>
                     <p>There is alſo differing opinions concerning the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</note> of offenders; <hi>Some hold that no externall power of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſinners belongeth to the office of Miniſters, but onely as by the word they can worke through the ſpirit, vpon mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, by publike admonition and reprehenſion; rebuking ſuch openly as ſinne openly: affirming that other puniſhments whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer appertaine to the Magiſtrate, when God beſtowes them vpon the Church: Others thinke that Miniſters may ſuſpend, and ſuperiour Eccleſiaſticall Gouernours withall excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi> And againe, <hi>there are which vtterly deny any ſuſpenſion

                     <p>To conclude the 18. of <hi>Mat.</hi> verſe 15. 20. and <hi>Leu.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

Read the booke intituled, <hi>Theſes de ritè gubernanda Eccleſia,</hi> the Authour without name, and yet an ouer-ſea Presbiteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, who proueth that diſcipline Eccleſiaſticall hath there no foundation, but it is meant, ſaith he, of priuate and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall iniuries, which he proueth from the coherence of the whole Chapter one part of it with another, from the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and manner of ſpeaking, from the abſurdities which would ariſe otherwiſe from it, from <hi>Peters</hi> queſtion, and the laſt words of Chriſts anſwere.</p>
                     <p>Now becauſe this place is ſo much in euery ſeely mans mouth, ſo much exalted by the Separatiſts, by the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, ſo troubleſome to the mindes of many, and ſo much deſired to be put in practiſe by ſome who yet here ſee it neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and being perſwaded that here the ſame cannot be
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14152:118"/> put in practiſe, and yet ought to be obſerued as the true rule of Church Diſcipline, ordained by Chriſt, by which ſome runne from vs, others remaining yet diſlike vs, as careleſſe of Chriſts gouernment: I will ſhew the iudgement of Diuines, who endeuour by reaſons to declare how theſe men are vtterly miſtaken, and are cleane from the true meaning of this place; as they doe thinke. Heare therefore what is, and may be ſaid, touchign this 18. of <hi>Mat.</hi> verſe 15. 16. 17.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Coherence with that before in the Chapter<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> is thus; Chriſt our Sauiour tels of ſcandals and of offences that ſhall be giuen, and admoniſheth his diſciples of them, and teacheth to auoid them, verſe 5. 6. 7. &amp;c: Then comes hee to iniuries offered, and ſhewes how men muſt carry themſelues towards ſuch as doe offer them wrong, in verſe 15. 16. 17. &amp;c. That this is the order, the Text may ſhew, and the matter fitly doth agree together; for hee firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth his to take heed of offending others; and then declareth how they are to cary themſelues towards ſuch as doe treſpaſſe againſt them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the occaſion of theſe words was (as is thought)<note place="margin">Occaſion.</note> the ſtate of thoſe dayes in our Sauiours time, wherein the Iewes were in ſubiection to the Romanes, hauing their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Elders greatly diminiſhed by the Romanes, who were Heathen, to whom ſome Iewes became ſeruants: theſe were Publicanes; of which was <hi>Zacheus,</hi> yea, and <hi>Matthew,</hi> one that ſat at the receipt of cuſtome; for which they were to the Iewes very hatefull, but therein ſeruants to the Romanes, and ſo freed from the power &amp; authoritie of the Iewes, with whom (as with the very Heathen &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles among them) what Iew ſoeuer would haue to doe for any wrong which they offered, that Iew muſt call theſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanes before Romane authoritie, and conuent them there, and not bring them into any Iewiſh Court; from which they were exempt by their ſeruice to the Romane ſtate: which libertie was alſo graunted to any other priuiledged Iew, which would make an appeale to the Romane Gouernour,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14152:118"/> as did Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> to whom the Iewes might haue recourſe if they would to recouer their rights, or redreſſe wrongs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the ſcope of our Sauiour, is held in this caſe here<note place="margin">The ſcope.</note> to be a moderating of the Iewes paſſions, ariſing one againſt another for wrongs receiued, that ſo they might not runne into extremities, as mans nature is both haſtie and deſirous of the vtmoſt reuenge at the firſt; he aduiſeth them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to deale at the firſt one with an other, as they muſt doe with Publicanes and Heathen, men hatefull to them, and exempted from all that power, which yet remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues; and againſt whom they held it lawfull to vſe all extremities to the vtmoſt: but to proceed lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly; firſt, after the rules of Charitie, which preſcribeth, firſt, all gentle meanes, and when theſe will not any way preuaile, then to vſe extremitie.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the meaning then of the words is; if thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">The meaning of the words. Here be three degrees of proceeding, and a threefold help in reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſer. 1. The rule of charitie. 2. <hi>Moſes</hi> order of policie, as much as then remained thereof. 3. And laſtly, the Romane Soueraigntie.</note> a Iew doe iniurie againſt thee that art a Iew, goe thou to him, and tell him of it betweene your ſelues alone; and if he acknowledge the wrong, and doth giue thee ſatisfaction, thou art to ceaſe further to call him into queſtion, as being reconciled, and hee wonne vnto thee by this thy louing carryage: but if hee doe deſpiſe thee (as but one to one) yet vſe not extremitie; but againe goe to him, and take with thee one or two, before whom thou mayeſt manifeſt the wrong receiued, that they may beare witneſſe of it, as alſo of thy charitable proceeding, and may be a meane to the ſame partie for thee, to conſider of his euils, to make thee recompence for the ſame: but if hee regard not their counſell neither; then complaine to the authoritie of the Iewiſh Synedrion, and let them perſwade him to deale well with thee, to ſatisfie in what hee hath done the iniury in. But if he become ſo graceleſſe and ſo wickedly obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate that he deſpiſe it, and ſo no ſuch meanes as theſe will doe him good; then vſe (if thou wilt) the vtmoſt remedie, deale with him, as if hee were not a faithfull Iew; that is, bring him before the Romane power, and ſue him at
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14152:119"/> 
                        <hi>Caeſars</hi> barre, as if he were a Publicane or Heathen. So then the place is vnderſtood of priuate and perſonall ſuites and quarrels betweene man and man Iew and Iew, as the ſtate ſtood then, of which our Sauiour did ſpeake.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, this to be the ſenſe, reaſons are alledged: firſt, the <note place="margin">Reaſons to proue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</note> cuſtome of our Sauiour in ſpeaking, whoſe manner was to ſpeake according to the time, &amp; to teach the Iewes then duties of loue one towards another, as he before did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23. 26. In which place he ſpeaketh Eccleſiaſtically and alſo ciuilly to the Iewes capacitie, as they might reape bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and gaine good by his doctrine, euen ſo in this place. Secondly, the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> ſo vnderſtanding our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as appeareth by the words of his queſtion, made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Sauiours ſpeech, verſe 21. Thirdly, our Sauiours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere agine vnto <hi>Peter,</hi> in a Parable, in which he ſpeakes of ſuch cauſes as fall out betweene man and man, priuate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and perſonall, in which one man hath right to retaine or remit the offence done againſt himſelfe. Fourthly, our Sauiours concluſion with a generall ſentence, concluding the whole matter. verſe 35. Fiftly, the words &amp; proprietie of ſpeech in the Text proue as much; for <hi>againſt thee,</hi> ſhewes the offence to be priuate, and perſonall, and ſuch as one partie offended might remit: againe, the word <hi>Brother,</hi> ſhewes how our Sauiour meant the Iewes then, for no Iew, nor as yet any Diſciple of Chriſt did account any other for brother but a Iew. Further more the ſpeech, thou <hi>haſt gained or won</hi> thy brother ſhewes a priuate alienation of mind in the party, that doth the iniurie: which by the gentle dealing of the partie offended, is as it were, recouered againe vnto him: beſides our Sauiour ſending of the offender backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the plaintiffes cenſure, after hee hath complained to the Church in theſe words, <hi>Let him be to thee;</hi> by which<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Beza Annot.</hi> by this reaſon vnderſtands the very word Church, to be meant of the Iewes.</note> is euident ſuch a Church to be meant, as the offender might not regard, and the Plaintiffe not get remedie by, but is diſmiſſed to further proceeding: ſo the matter is ſtill perſonall. Laſtly, the words <hi>Publican and Heathen,</hi> words of reproach then among the Iewes, (who onely of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14152:119"/> all Nations did then diſdaine the Gentiles) doe declare Chriſts meaning to be of the Iewes at that time.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the place of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> Chap. 17. 3. doth help alſo this Expoſition; which place is the very ſame with this of <hi>Matthew,</hi> but that it is more briefly ſet downe, then it is here.</p>

Againe here is no mention made of any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; neither doth Chriſt in this Chapter ſpeake of any particular office of publike perſons, but of ſuch things as concerned the people of God, euen the Iewes then, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now: why then ſhould the ſenſe of all the reſt be made anſwerable to this, and not this verſe interpreted ſo as it may agree with the reſt? for although theſe words may carry ſuch a ſhew, as to draw this verſe to the Miniſterie onely, by the foreſaid miſtaking, yet if it be obſerued: firſt, that the words are generall: ſecondly, that therefore the expoſition of a generall may be brought to a neceſſarie co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of diuerſe particulars: thirdly, that our Sauiour in ſome ſort expounds this difficultie in verſes 19. 20. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the agreeing of two or three; by which it may ſeem, he hath reference to verſe 15. and 16. thereby to confirme the peace made betweene the two parties, eyther alone, or with their witneſſes, declaring how acceptable it is to God, leaſt it ſhould be deſpiſed: there is no cauſe why this 18. verſe ſhould make a iarre in the apt expoſition of all the former and latter verſes, agreeing very fitly together. To conclude, it cannot be denyed, but that <hi>to binde and loſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto the Miniſterie, which power our Sauiour gaue his Apoſtles afterward: <hi>Iohn.</hi> 20. 23. which they did, and Miniſters now doe performe by vertue of their office ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Chriſts roome and ſtead, and ſo doe they binde and loſe otherwiſe then doe common Chriſtians, yet it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followes not, that theſe Chriſtians doe not or may not binde or loſe at all. Miniſters doe pray, teach and endeuor to bring men to Chriſt, and this is his office, and as publike perſons; yet others may teach alſo: ſo are Parents com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,<note place="margin">Deut.</note> and euery Chriſtian man is bound to <hi>edifie his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I haue before ſaid much to this, yet will I here ſay ſomething more, to the further clearing of this point. Our Church made a voluntarie departing, in the Beginners of Reformation, her late Maieſtie, with others, who ſtood out
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14152:131"/> in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes: theſe profeſſing in time of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, cannot be ſaid otherwiſe to become Gods Church, then by a voluntarie inclining of the heart by the motion of Gods ſpirit. This firſt Company, who and how many ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they were, were the Church of God, from which the other, which did adioyne to them, by what meanes ſoeuer, became one with them, to be called together the Church of God; and thus after Apoſtacie, began the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to be reformed. And it is here to be noted, that the<note place="margin">Planting and and reforming are differing things.</note> planting of a Church, is one thing and after one manner; but the recouering of Gods people out of the hands of their enimies, ſhaking off ſpirituall bondage, and reforming of it from corruptions, is an other.</p>
                  <p>This may be made plaine by a ſimilitude from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon<note place="margin">A Simile to ſet out the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the firſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Church, and the after refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the ſame.</note> of <hi>Iob,</hi> who firſt by Gods making, at his firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was cleane and comely; but by Sathan through Gods permiſſion, was <hi>Iob</hi> filled full, and couered ouer with bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſoares, as made him hardly to be knowne to his friends, and loathed of the nigheſt to him; yet was <hi>Iob</hi> there ſtill vnder the ſcabs, and not vtterly deſtroyed, but the very ſame eſſentially that was before; ſo as to exalt <hi>Iob</hi> againe, God was not to make a new <hi>Iob,</hi> but theſe botches and byles which ouer-ſhadowed <hi>Iob,</hi> was to be cured, and he cleanſed of them, that <hi>Iob</hi> might appeare againe like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as God made him, and not as Sathan had defiled him. So is it with the Church; firſt, in the planting purely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, but Sathan hee commeth and pollutes it with the botches and byles of Antichriſtianiſme; which doth not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy the Church, but couereth it ouer ſo as the true children of the kingdome can hardly diſcern the ſame; which Church is to be purged of theſe abhominations, and made to appeare, and to come out from vnder theſe ſcabs, but not to be made a new. For the firſt planting or conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> of a Church, differs much from the reforming of a Church after back-ſliding. Firſt, at the planting it is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of Chriſtians, before no <hi>Chriſtians at all:</hi> but in the reformation after apoſtacie, the Church is not re-eſtablſhed<note place="margin">1. Difference.</note>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:14152:132"/> of ſuch as were no Chriſtians by their fall, and made Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by reformation, as if they before had loſt their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie; but were Chriſtians vnder great corruptions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly<note place="margin">2. Difference.</note> in planting, Infidels become outward Profeſſours of Chriſt, who did not before acknowledge him: but in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Profeſſours of Chriſt become outwardly more holy, and purer from corruptions; Apoſtates in corruption become Apoſtolicall in Religion, and that which once they were before. Thirdly, in the firſt plantation is required a<note place="margin">3. Difference.</note> profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, and ſuch as profeſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him are to be baptiſed, hauing neuer before beene admitted into the Church nor baptiſed: but in reformation there is not required a profeſſion into the name of Chriſt, nor that the parties returning ſhould be baptiſed, becauſe they held a profeſſion of Chriſt, and loſt not their baptiſme, but repentance and profeſſion of amendement of life is onely required. Wee may ſee this true for the planting of Churches by the Apoſtles; &amp; for reformation of Iudah, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great Idolatrie of <hi>Achah;</hi> and the Iſraelites turning to God in <hi>Hezechias</hi> dayes, in which was no gathering againe of the foreskinne, for renewing of Circumciſion, but after repentance, &amp; ſubmitting of themſelues, though ſome of compulſion, as in <hi>Ioſias</hi> time, yet were they admitted, as Iſraelites, &amp; accounted the true Church of God. Either the not vnderſtanding, or the neglect of this, made M. <hi>Smith</hi> ſeeke a new Baptiſme, as if the Romiſh Church had made an nullitie of all Chriſtianitie, he might as well haue betaken himſelfe to a new God, and Chriſt. And the not making of this plaine cauſeth the ſimple people to thinke that the Goſpell in the laſt time of reformation, was onely thruſt vpon vs, and not receiued of the Church voluntarily. Fourthly and laſtly, in planting, <hi>Paul</hi> muſt goe before with<note place="margin">4 Difference.</note> the word, but in reformation <hi>Ioſias</hi> may compell with the feare of the ſword; for in this the Authoritie of Kings is great, who are <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi> to the Church: <hi>Fathers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beget, as it were publike Churches, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are more hidden in ſecret places: <hi>Nurſing,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:14152:132"/> vphold them, defend them, and doe cauſe ſuch as be vnder them to maintaine them. Thus was, as is ſaid, <hi>Iudah</hi> brought backe by <hi>Hezechias, Ioſias,</hi> and others, as we alſo were from Antichriſt, by our Godly <hi>Ioſias,</hi> King <hi>Edward,</hi> and by our renowned <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that Queene of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who delighted to aduance the wiſedome of her <hi>Salomon,</hi> the word of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Miſcreants doe diſpiſe this grace, and curſed are thoſe Catiffes, which mocke at theſe meanes, which the Lord hath raiſed vp to vs his people, who hath ſtretched out his arme for our deliuerance, to the terrour of nations: elſe had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe cenſorious and condemning Separatiſts periſhed in the wombe, or had beene borne to dye, by an vntimely death.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, I ſay, that the generall profeſſion of this truth, after this manner, in theſe ſixe things, maketh ſuch as be in many things ignorant, to be true matter in that Church; ſo it be, that there be withall other who in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſcience intertaine the maine truths of God from the beginning: for wee muſt know, firſt, that the<note place="margin">How a people are a true Church, though wicked men doe ariſe vp among them after the firſt conſtitution. 1. <hi>Cor. 1.

Thus <hi>Corinth,</hi> and the Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> held the name of the Church, becauſe there were ſuch as did maintaine the truth firſt publiſhed and receiued. Now the late Queene with many other, did voluntarily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin reformation, they of knowledge profeſſed this truth, and many of them ſuffered for it, againſt Poperie; let this man tell me whether they were to be accounted Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? If he ſay yea, conſidered by themſelues, then ſay I, the ſame truth in the ſame degree hitherto maintained, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſuch ſtill to the true people of God; and for the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of others ariſing in the Church, let him, if hee and all
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:14152:146"/> his can, proue that the Church ſo ceaſeth to be a Church, and the good nothing to be eſteemed, becauſe of the bad among them: thirdly, I ſay, that the better part giueth the name of the whole, though the ſame be fewer in number by many; thus <hi>Sardis</hi> is called a Church, for the <hi>few</hi> names<note place="margin">

                     <p>Now in the Lords doing of this; firſt, hee giueth them<note place="margin">How God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a people his people.</note> 
                        <hi>his word,</hi> which is 1. <hi>his ordinance to make men his people,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. Mar. 16. 16. 2. <hi>His power to ſubdue them,</hi> Rom. 1 16. 2 Cor. 10. 4. 5.

So to the Iſraelites comming out of Egipt, he gaue them his word by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſeales to confirme the ſame, which is well knowne. And as in the old Teſtament,

And thus are a people ſet vp of the Lord to be his people: and in theſe three things onely doe ſtand Gods viſible act in chooſing for his part a people to be his: reſpecting no goodneſſe in them, but chooſing them of his loue and mercy. <hi>Deu.</hi> 7. 7. 8. and 9. 5. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
                     <p>Here note, that God doth <hi>thus</hi> make a people his who were not his before <hi>viſibly;</hi> but to <hi>recouer</hi> his people fallen<note place="margin">How the Lord reformeth his people.</note> from him, and to hold them ſtill with him, hee then refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them, and bringeth them backe chiefely by the power of Authoritie; ſo did hee bringthe Iſraelites backe againe to Gods worſhip by valiant Captaines, after the people had fallen by Idolatry: for they fell from Gods true worſhip: <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 11. 12. then the Lord puniſhed them: verſe. 14. then when they cryed, chap. 3. 9 the Lord raiſed vp <hi>Iudges</hi> and deliuered them, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 16. and while ſuch Iudges did liue, they did continue in the true worſhip. verſe 19 So did <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> bring the people to the Lord againe: 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. ſo did <hi>Hezechias</hi> and <hi>Ioſias.</hi> And thus doth God make and continue a people his people.

                        <note place="margin">In what doth the foundation of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſtand.</note>

A man and a woman doe couenant together lawfully in marriage, the word of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all promiſe paſſeth ſolemnely betweene them to performe mutuall duties, and the man giueth a token to confirme the profeſſion of his loue and truth therein, which ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: now ſhee after is a very diſobedient wife, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the particulars of the Couenant; but herein is ſhee iuſt, ſhee holds none other her husband; ſhee ſtands vnto the generall Couenant, and ſhee keepeth the token thereof: Though ſhee be diſobedient otherwiſe in many things, yet is there a Couenant made and remaineth, ſo as yet there is true man and wife. And thus is it with his Church, as the example of the Iſraelites doth ſhew; of whom it is ſaid, that they were a <hi>ſtiffe-necked people, Deut.</hi> 9. 6. who often prouoked God to anger. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. and <hi>alwayes</hi> reſiſted the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. yet had they couenanted with God, as <hi>Deut. 26. 17.

It cannot be proued therefore that a people haue not couenanted with God becauſe of their perſonall euils in the Church; nor that therfore they be none of the Lords people, except it can be alſo proued, that God hath caſt them of, and choſen others.

                        <hi>priuiledge;</hi> the difference whereof is, that an eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie ariſeth from within, but a priuiledge from without: the one, to wit, the propertie eſſentiall, maketh to the being of the Church, the other to the well being, but not ſimply to make it to be: of the one there can be no want, of the other there may be viſibly. To make this plaine, take the ſimilitude of a man and wife, vſed (as I haue ſhewed before) by the Holy Ghoſt often in the Scripture: the properties of a wife is, firſt, <hi>to hold only ſuch a one for her huſband, whom ſhe hath choſen:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>to keepe to the words of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, by which ſhee was and is tyed to that huſband.</hi> Theſe two are eſſentiall properties, by which ſhee is <hi>a wife,</hi> and and without which ſhee is <hi>no wife:</hi> there be other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties alſo, as <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>care for her huſbands well fare,</hi> with other moe; but if ſhee faile in theſe, yet is ſhee a wife, ſo long as in the other ſhe remaineth conſtant.

                     <p>The ſecond Propertie is, to hold the words of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,<note place="margin">The ſecond Propertie</note> that is, to <hi>profeſſe</hi> that the <hi>written</hi> word of God by his Prophets and Apoſtles, is onely the words of her Lords co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, as the bond of his promiſes, and her faith, and alſo the onely and ſole rule of her obedience.

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:14152:151"/> which bindeth each partie on either ſide, that haue made a couenant. God is no way a God in Chriſt vnto a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<note place="margin">A preuention.</note> to make them his Church viſibly, neither doth coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them ſo to be, but as hee doth giue them his word, to beget them, and to witneſſe to them the ſame. And therefore the word of God is called Gods couenant, <hi>Leu. 2. 13. Deu. 29. 1. Exod. 6. 4. Leu. 25. 25. 42. Ier.</hi> 11. 2. This can they not ſay that the Papiſts doe; for they do hold an other word then Gods word, to be the words of the Couenant; to wit, <hi>Traditions,</hi> the <hi>ſuppoſed vnerring voyce of the Church;</hi> when as the words of the Couenant are <hi>onely Gods words.</hi> God firſt offers himſelfe vnto vs, hee onely maketh the writing of the Couenant, man doth not meddle with the inditing thereof, the Church is onely to conſent therevnto, as the <hi>truth of God,</hi> the <hi>ground of faith,</hi> and <hi>rule of obedience,</hi> and ſo receiue it at him. The Papiſts therefore by their traditions and vnwritten verities, as they call them, and by their imagined vnerring Eccleſiaſticall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, impoſed as truths of God, grounds of faith, and rules of ſpirituall obedience, doe interline the Lords coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and adde a new word thereunto, contrary to his will, and ſo doe make the commandements, that is, the words of the couenant of none effect by their traditions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 3. So doe they goe alſo a whoring after their owne inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith; and in not keeping to the Lords<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.</note> commandements, haue turned away from him. Now our<note place="margin">
                           <hi>King.</hi> 9. 6.</note> Church holdeth to the couenant, for we doe hold no words to be the words of the couenant, but the words of God, written in the holy Scriptures, by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: for this ſee <hi>our booke of Artilces, our booke of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies</hi> againſt the Papiſts in this point, allowed by publike authoritie.</p>
                     <p>The third propertie is, to maintaine the publication of this<note place="margin">The third pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie.</note> Couenant, by the reading of it in her Aſſemblies, and by the interpretation thereof, to which ſhee doth attend: by this the Church is kept in viſibilitie, and is ſet as it were on a hill; by this meanes wiſedome cryeth in the ſtreetes, and calleth
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14152:152"/> her louers and friends to come vnto her: by this her Lords banners are diſplayed, and trumpets ſounded to gather the Lords hoaſt together, to march all vnder his colours: by this is held out his Scepter, that all may know vnder whoſe gouernment they be. And this is a true and eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of the Church viſibly ſeene, by which it is ſet forth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 27. and wherein ſhee doth continue. <hi>Acts. 2. 42. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 1. Which propertie of ſo meeting together being loſt, ſhee <note n="*" place="margin">Note here then what an euill men of place commit, who neglect the publike Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies by ſtaying at home: and whether this be a ſin in the Miniſters, who then teach pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, it is to be conſidered of, eſpecially in an orderly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed church inhibiting the ſame.</note> ceaſeth to be a viſible Church, and is but as a ſcattered flocke, ſheepe wandring without a ſhepheard. Now this propertie hath our Church, which is gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in many Aſſemblyes, where the words of the Couenant are read, and the ſame in many places interpreted vnto them. We haue no Papiſtical lying legend, or other humane traſh in an vnknowne tongue, for the Church commeth to the Law and to the Couenant, which is onely written in the words of God, and not of man.</p>
                     <p>And thus wee doe ſee the maine and eſſentiall properties viſible, by which <hi>it is a Church,</hi> and alſo <hi>viſible and open to the eye of all:</hi> the want of the two firſt maketh it <hi>no church;</hi> the want of this third no <hi>viſible Congregation.</hi> And where theſe be, there is a true viſible Church.

                        <hi>care for and ouer one another,</hi> though it be eſſentiall <hi>for the well being,</hi> yet is it not ſimply <hi>for the being of</hi> a Church, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it riſe <hi>ſo primarily</hi> in ſuch fulneſſe from the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as either the vſe of the Sacraments or prayer doe: but onely it followes by a conſequence, and ariſeth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Church conſidered as <hi>a bodie,</hi> a <hi>fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>ſocietie;</hi> which whither it be Eccleſiaſticall, or ciuill, is to care for the preſeruation of the ſeuerall members, to keepe vp the whole. And further, becauſe that the Church is a Church, though there be in it diuiſions, and members tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor. 3. 3. 2. Cor.</hi> 12. 20.</note> in ſunder one another, as it fell out in <hi>Corinth,</hi> I haue paſſed it ouer more briefly, and ſet it in the laſt place.</p>
                     <p>By all this which hath beene ſaid, we may well ſee, that<note place="margin">What wants and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be in a Church, and yet the ſame be a true Church.</note> the vſe of ſome of the <hi>Properties,</hi> may for a time <hi>want;</hi> as the vſe of the Sacraments, the care for one another, and the vſe of Diſcipline; ſo as corruptions may be, euen in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and yet the Church be a true Church; and the reaſon is manifeſt, for if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments may be wanting, &amp; yet a true Church, then the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of the Sacraments corruptly adminiſtred, cannot make the Church a falſe church, which is true without them. Againe, there may be corruption in prayer, both in the matter which men aske, and in the manner of asking, ſo be, the two firſt properties remaine ſound, and yet the ſame people be a true Church: becauſe the perſon giuing the Couenant, and the Couenant it ſelfe is held, by which (as is ſhewed) the Church is a true Church: as alſo becauſe (as wee haue heard) that prayer is a gift indeed from God, but hath his being in vs, and vſed by vs, and we being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, it alſo may ſo be. Laſtly, there may be corruption
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14152:153"/> in the tranſlation of the word, and in the Churches inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the word, and ſo falſe Doctrines ariſe, and be maintained; yet not being in the fundamentall points of the Couenant before mentioned, the church may be a true church, though corrupted. For it is to be knowne, that the words of the couenant, that is, the holy ſcriptures haue who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their exiſtence from God; as he did by his Spirit extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily inſpire the Prophets and Apoſtles, pen-men of the ſame, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21. but the ordinary interpretation hath the being from vs, which is either true or falſe, as God doth pleaſe ordinarily to informe mens iudgements to ſee the true ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt: and therefore the Church not denying the Couenant it ſelfe, but acknowledging <hi>it ſo, (as is aforeſaid</hi>) reiecting all words or traditions, put in roome thereof, the ſame church remaineth a true Church, though ſhee miſconceiue the ſenſe in ſome places of the ſame, and ſo collect ſome falſe doctrines from the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Whence I alſo conclude, that though corruptions were in adminiſtration of the Sacraments, in tranſlation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in prayers, yea, &amp; that care ouer one another be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected: all which are neuertheleſſe great corruptions to be lamented, and ought carefully to be amended with all diligence for the Churches proſperitie, yet in ſuch a church for all theſe corruptions, may be a true Church: which may ſerue for anſwere to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Smiths</hi> holding of <hi>accidentall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Page 90.</note> obſtinately defended, to make a falſe church; which appeareth by theſe things to be as falſe, as he is variably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant.</p>
                     <p>Now touching the <hi>Priuiledges</hi> of the true viſible church,<note place="margin">The Church may want for a time her priuiledges.</note> theſe be for inſtances ſome of them: firſt, to be called by theſe titles, Saints, faithfull, Elect; ſecondly, it is giuen to them to ſuffer for Chriſt; thirdly, to be the Arke to keepe the Bookes of the Couenant, the holy Scriptures, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Heauen; fourthly, to ſet too the Seales vnto the Lords Couenant; fiftly, to vſe the Keyes to open and to ſhut the Kingdome of heauen.

                     <p>Firſt, they are called and ſent of God, which calling and<note place="margin">Called and ſent of God, &amp; how.</note> ſending of God, is the preparing of men with gifts and graces, to be able to execute in ſome meaſure, the office whereunto hee doth appoint them.

And thus were they furniſhed, and did proceed on to execute their great charge impoſed vpon them. Thus wee ſee what is Gods calling; I ſpeake not here<note place="margin">A preuention.</note> of extraordinarie, though the inſtance be from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as if all ſhould be ſo furniſhed now, and in that manner, but the purpoſe of my ſpeach is, to ſhew hereby that God doth ſend none, but hee qualifieth them with gifts, <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie perſons with extraordinary gifts, by an extraordinary meanes, or without meanes;</hi> but ordinary men with ordinary
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:14152:156"/> gifts, by a common meanes, giuing them naturall gifts; by the holy ſcriptures, grace &amp; by ſtudy, learning, but he ſends none, but thus either the one way or other he doth qualifie them for their vocation. Now it is manifeſt to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that we haue men worthily qualified with gifts both of Nature, Art and Grace, and ſuch therefore ſent of God. Which furniſhing with gifts maketh a man fit matter for the Miniſterie, and Gods ſpirit mouing him to deſire to imploy that way the ſame gift, is as it were the internall forme of a Miniſter, or Gods ordination by the impoſition of the hand of his ſpirit vpon that partie for the Miniſterie, to whom nothing wants but the viſible calling of the Church: and thus we ſee the calling of God.</p>

Laſtly, in all theſe places we doe ſee indeed an Election among the people, but the people did not aſſume it as a right of themſelues, but vpon the Apoſtles exhortation, and a graunt vnto them, for the time the people made the choiſe.

                        <hi>An.</hi> Well therfore, I will ſhew: <hi>firſt, that here is conuerſion in the Church,</hi> and <hi>ſecondly, that yet ſuch ſo conuerted, were not before that conuerſion Infidels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt I thus proue: If men in our Church formerly<note place="margin">There is true conuerſion in our Church.</note> prophane and irreligious in many things, haue viſibly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking that lewd courſe, by no compulſarie law of man, but by an inward feare of God wrought by Gods word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">Many of the latter ſort de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from vs.</note> as <hi>themſelues</hi> haue confeſſed, then haue ſuch men beene conuerted, and ſo a true conuerſion wrought in our Church by the Miniſterie of the word. The latter will not be denyed, if the former be proued: for what is a mans vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible conuerſion, but an outward confeſſion of ſorrow for ſinne, a leauing of the ſame, and an endeuour to doe well voluntarily, after the good pleaſure of God, manifeſted vnto him? <hi>Prou. 28. 13. Mat. 3. 6. Luke</hi> 15. 18. 21 24. But ſuch a conuerſion hath beene, and is daily wrought in our Church, and the inſtances are infinite. For proofe of this, I referre him vnto many thouſands now with vs, who will auouch thus much, and I alſo appeale to the hearts and conſciences of ſuch of themſelues as are departed from vs. Did they not here leaue off to doe wickedly, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture firſt led them? did they not reioyce in the word, which
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:14152:162"/> before they careleſly neglected? did they not ſuffer mocks of others, once like themſelues, for not ſtill running to the ſame exceſſe of ryot, as in times before? And did they not<note place="margin">

But I hope better of ſome, who I truſt (at the length) will ſee our Church to be a true Church, and returne, as ſome haue done to their mother againe, or at the leaſt will reforme their opinions, vnto the godly iudgements of the reformed Churches, as they hold of vs, and louingly conſent with vs, that God may ſhew them mercie in this their great ſchiſme, and gricuous ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Gods Church, to the hinderance of the Goſpell, and the great aduantage of the enemies thereof.<note place="margin">Men conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our Church, were not before In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond point, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch ſo conuerted are no Infidels before, I manifeſt, firſt, by diſtinction, for there is <hi>a double conuerſion,</hi> the <hi>firſt is primarily the profeſſion of Chriſt,</hi> and before this are men Infidels, and not of the Church of Chriſt viſibly; ſo were the <hi>Romanes, Corinthians, Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> and the reſt conuerted from Gentiliſme to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie: the <hi>other is ſecondarily to ſanctification of life,</hi> and this is of members in the Church, who are not borne in perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall holineſſe, but are brought to a godly conuerſation by the word in their appointed time. And thus is the word <hi>to conuert</hi> or <hi>returne</hi> vſed in Scripture, and vnderſtood of ſuch, as be members of the true Church, though lewd and very wicked before their change of life. <hi>Eſai.</hi> 6. 10. and 10. 21. <hi>Iere 31. 18. 19. Luk.</hi> 22. 32. and therefore this conuerſion doth not preſuppoſe infidelitie, as the not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt doth. Secondly, If where conuerſion is, there muſt needs be alſo before infidelitie, then when men doe ſall to Idolatrie from God, and be brought backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that is, be conuerted; then muſt there be a rebapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for Infidels are to be baptiſed. This man, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohnſon</hi> alſo, doth acknowledge a conuerſion
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14152:163"/> now from Antichriſtianiſme, are therefore all ſuch before Infidels? then hath not M. <hi>Smith</hi> done ill to be againe baptiſed: for whoſoeuer in the ſcripture are called Infidels, are wholy without the Church, and muſt by baptiſme be admitted into the Church: hee vſeth to quote Scripture often, if he vſe but a word, or doe but allude vnto a place of Scripture, why doth he not here quote Scripture to proue the vſe of the tearme <hi>Infidell?</hi> let him (if hee be able) ſhew that any by the Scriptures are called <hi>Infidels,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the Name of Chriſt, though very lewd in life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation: if hee cannot, as I am ſure hee cannot, why doth he herein leaue the Scripture, and take vpon him beſides and againſt Scripture, ſo to conclude as here he doth?</p>
                     <p>Two Scriptures I quoted in my former Booke <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Page 129. <hi>Rom. 10. 14. 1.

If the Apoſtles worke and ſeale of his miniſterie was not before officers were ſet ouer the people, what, and whoſe worke was it <hi>to make Diſciples?</hi> as Chriſt commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. and as they be called <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 20. 22. before they had Elders ſet ouer them, verſe. 23.</p>
                     <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> after this doth but repeat what I haue alledged and made anſwere before vnto, and giuen reaſons thereof, page 129. to which hee could not anſwere, yet would hee make the ſame obiection againe. Belike hee thought men would read his anſwere without comparing it with my booke, indeed if ſo men doe, it were eaſie to carry away a cauſe, and much labour ſhould be ſpent in vaine, nothing ſaid, and much ſaid, yet neuer the neare to giue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſatisfation. He quoteth 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. &amp;c, to proue that the worke and ſeale of <hi>Pauls</hi> Apoſtleſhip was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14.</note> of beleeuers from Infidels; If the man were in his right minde and that the conceited excellencie of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration had not bewitched him, hee would neuer ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly haue alledged the place to proue this point.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the place neither mentioneth the Seale of his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14152:164"/> Miniſterie, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. neither doth expound his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as doth 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. 3. 6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the place ſhewes not their ſeparation, but is an Exhortation from the fellowſhip of Infidels, whereby is manifeſt rather, their <hi>not whole ſeparation</hi> from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as the place it ſelfe, the iudgement of Diuines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the exhortation in it owne nature doth plainely euince: the Apoſtle ſaith, be not vnequally yoked with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, Ergo ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> they had made a Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. A ridiculous conſequent; by as good a reaſon wee may conclude that all gods people are come out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, becauſe <hi>Iohn (Reu.</hi> 18. 4) bad them to leaue Babylon; and that men are ſuch as they ſhould be, for that they are forbidden to be what they are: ſuch Doctrines would make a ſpeedy reformation, that we need not ſuch Schiſmaticall departures, neither haue wee by his Doctrine any wicked among vs, for we haue exhorted, and doe ſtill dehort men from their prophaneneſſe of life and conuerſation, and then why maketh hee with his a ſeparation? Therefore ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then by his conſequence from hence wee be ſeparated, as hee would conclude of me, ſo ſay I that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> is a falſe Doctor (as his workes ſhew) if he be any at all.</p>
                     <p>Hee ſkips ouer an Objection and an Anſwere, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Ordination by Byſhops, Page 142. and alſo the place of <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. Page 143. hee paſſeth by, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with a ſleight anſwere vnto that which I lay to their charge in making their <hi>Miniſters</hi> by merely lay men, and ſuch as are no Miniſters at all: my reaſons againſt that practiſe is layd downe in my former Booke, page. 144. 145. hee anſweres nothing particularly to the ſeuerall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Scriptures as hee ought, and as hee would, if hee could haue oppoſed the truth with any ſhew of truth, but the ſtreame runneth too cleare from the worlds beginning for him to throw in durt and not be ſeene; or to turne the force of ſuch a current, and hee not be drowned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, yet will hee blunder the water with his feet, and withſtand the ſtreame as well as hee may, and therefore hee

I then demaund, may not Gods truths and his ordinance receiued among the wicked, be carryed foorth from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and the ſame be acknowledged to be thence receiued, but we muſt needs thereby teach to goe backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto them? The Babylonians tooke away the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Lord, and afterward the Iewes receiued them againe, at the hands of ſuch as were wicked and Idolatrous, might they not receiue them, but muſt needs teach that therefore men muſt leaue Ieruſalem, and turne backe into Babylon? Doth not M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> know, that it is one thing to receiue once a good thing with corruptions igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, and another thing hauing receiued that good and caſt off the corruptions, to returne againe, to receiue the good with corruptions, when there is no cauſe? Againe, I demaund whether the Apoſtacie of Antichriſt ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing the Church of God, doth make a flat nullitie of all Gods truths, and his ordinances, ſo as they be no truths nor ordinances of God, becauſe the ſame paſſe by them, and for that we receiue them from them? If hee ſay no, then why doth he diſſallow our ordination abſolutely? If hee ſay yea, then are wee not baptiſed neither they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and ſo are no viſible Chriſtians receiued into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church by Baptiſme, for wee receiued our Baptiſme from them by ſucceſſion? If our Baptiſme muſt needs be held true, then why not ordination? What diſanulleth one ordinance of God more then an other? and if the holding of our receiuing the Miniſters calling from them, make them a true Church, what lets but the ſame may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded likewiſe from Baptiſme? and that more ſtrongly, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Baptiſme being a viſible badge of the viſible Church of Chriſt, and the knitting of the members together, which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14152:165"/> are by the word wonne to the profeſſion of the faith?</p>
                     <p>To the retorted Argument of the Papiſts againſt vs, which he doth bring, if what I haue ſaid do not content him, let him ſend to the firſt framer of the argument, who is able<note place="margin">Doct.

For my part when I plead with a Papiſt, as I now doe with a Browniſt, hee ſhall ſee mee anſwere as I may, or if he had framed the Papiſts Reaſon from him, eyther to maintaine themſelues againſt vs, or to ouerthrow vs in what wee doe ſtand in againſt them, hee ſhould haue had a preſent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. To conclude this, Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> hath not yet ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne my Reaſons made againſt their courſe in making of Miniſters, but that they doe ſtand as no Miniſters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſo as <hi>no Scripture</hi> doth giue warrant, nor <hi>any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> of the like recorded <hi>in the word of God,</hi> from the worlds beginning.

                           </label> I anſwere, that it is no Sillogiſme; for neyther part of the queſtion is in the <hi>Maior,</hi> but a changed tearme; for there is great difference betweene the word <hi>Miniſterie</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters:</hi> he pretends Art, and ſhewes nothing leſſe: but this is his Logicke for poore ſeely Layicks, and good enough for them that would ouerthrow Vniuerſities. Againe, I deny the <hi>Maior;</hi> for firſt, why may not as well true Miniſters ariſe out of a falſe Church, as a falſe Miniſterie, Worſhip, and Gouernment ariſe out of a true Church, as himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoucheth?<note place="margin">Page 14.</note> Secondly, wee ſee by experience, that <hi>Luther,</hi> and other worthy Miniſters of Chriſt haue beene raiſed vp out of the Romiſh Church. Thirdly, againe I demand, why true Miniſters may not ariſe out of ſuch a Church, as well as true Baptiſme, or as Gods people being in it, and yet come out from it? If ſo much of Chriſtianitie doth remaine in the Antichriſtian Church, as maketh the people ſtill Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the conſtitution of it at the firſt, which at length com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth<note place="margin">

But hee confirmeth his <hi>Maior</hi> by that which before bee deliuered touching Chriſts miniſteriall power giuen to the Congregation, and by that which he hath ſaid againſt ſucceſſion. Which proofes are before ouerthrowne, and ſo his <hi>Maior</hi> lyeth in the duſt: and if his reaſons were not refelled; yet are they very ridiculouſly alledged to proue his <hi>Maior,</hi> except hee can frame them better to it, then I ſee how: for thus his <hi>Maior</hi> dependeth vpon his
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14152:166"/> reaſons <hi>the calling of Miniſters is not by ſucceſſion, but from the body of the Congregation:</hi> Ergo, <hi>the true Miniſterie cannot be raiſed out of a falſe Church.</hi> Here againe, is Tinterton Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the cauſe of Goodwin ſands.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> I deny alſo, for the Church of England is a true Church, as I haue before proued at large, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his reaſons, on which in his aſſumption here, hee onely did relye, without any further proofe. But his ill ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Argument doth well ſerue to be turned vpon himſelfe thus. <hi>The true Miniſterie cannot be raiſed out of a falſe Church. But</hi> M. <hi>Smiths Anabaptiſticall Aſſemblie is a falſe Church: Therefore neither</hi> M. <hi>Smith, nor any els of that Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, is a true Miniſter.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> hee holds true: the <hi>Minor</hi> may be confirmed, becauſe (as he ſaith) a falſe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme<note place="margin">See his Booke againſt M. <hi>Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi>
                           </note> maketh a falſe Church, or ſuch are no Church which are not baptiſed: but hee, and thoſe which were baptiſed by him, are eyther falſely baptiſed, or not baptiſed at all. For firſt, they holde our Baptiſme as no baptiſme; and ſo in that reſpect are not baptiſed. Secondly, he ſaith, that true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is when one baptiſed doth baptiſe another into the<note place="margin">In his anſwere to me, Page 91. line. 28.</note> faith of Chriſt, capable of Baptiſme. Now hee did baptiſe, and was not baptiſed before, as hee acknowledgeth, and he did baptiſe others not capable of his Baptiſme, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued before <hi>a true Baptiſme,</hi> in <hi>matter</hi> the water, <hi>in forme</hi> the words of the inſtitution pronounced: now let him proue if he can, by the new Teſtament, that any ſo baptiſed as we be, or by the approbation of any Orthodoxall Church, that ſuch are to receiue Baptiſme againe: if hee cannot, then were they not capable of Baptiſme and ſo by his owne words are they not baptiſed. Thirdly, that bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which the word doth not warrant, is a falſe baptiſing; for thus they doe reaſon in other things: for the word war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranting an action, maketh it truely diuine in Gods worſhip. But firſt, M. <hi>Smith</hi> did baptiſe himſelfe contrary to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which commandeth one to baptiſe an other. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18.) and contrary to all examples in Scripture, euen in Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 3. neither can the like act be ſhewed to be
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:14152:166"/> done by any ſince Chriſt was borne: ſithen then his act be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the intendment of him diuine, and the truth thereof depending vpon the Scripture, it being againſt the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without warrant of Chriſt, of his Apoſtles, or of any Chriſtian Church, it muſt needes then be a falſe baptiſing, with which all the reſt are polluted, as being the beginning of their Anabaptiſticall conſtitution, and by which all the other entred into baptiſme. Fourthly, their baptiſme is falſe, becauſe it wanteth the true forme; for they helde not the<note place="margin">Witneſſe <hi>Ia.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14152:167"/> the Miniſterie of the Church of Rome. Our Miniſterie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe not from the Romiſh Church, as from a voluntarie procreating cauſe, as hee abſurdly maketh a ſimilie of a father and his ſonne; but it aroſe from vnder the bondage of that Church, through Gods power retaining the good and leauing the euill thereof. Therefore that which ariſeth out of good amongſt corruptions, is not of the nature of the corruptions, but of the good ouerſhadowed with thoſe corruptions. Who knowes not that Gods people are in Babilon, and that they doe ariſe out of the Romiſh Church? doth it therefore follow that when they are riſen out of it, that they be of the ſame nature with it, becauſe they doe bring the good things with them there learned and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from vnder the corruptions?</p>
                        <p>Againe, he teacheth in this his Reaſon a groſſe Errour, for hee extendeth not our Miniſterie, and the orignall thereof, beyond the preſent Antichriſtian ſtate of the <hi>Now Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> but teacheth that there it had his firſt foundation, which is moſt vntrue: for our Miniſterie thus refined from the Popiſh Church, hath the beginning from before Antichriſt was hatched in the Romiſh Church: as may appeare by the Greeke Churches at this day, in which are Archbiſhops, Byſhops, and other inferiour officers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Pariſhionall Aſſemblies, and in which they haue read Prayer, and other like exerciſes of Religion with vs; now theſe Churches are more ancient (at leaſt ſome of them) then the Church of Rome, and were before that Romane Antichriſt, and therefore our Miniſterie is for originalitie to be conſidered before the now Romiſh Church, though it did runne a time through it (as pure water from a pure fountaine may doe through a dirtie chanell for a while) till God gaue it a clearer iſſue. This being conſidered, his ſimilie from refining of Sugar, to be ſtill Sugar, is fit for vs; for our Miniſterie being as Sugar, but heretofore full of droſſe, by refining it from the Romiſh Church, we haue it more pure, but not ſtill to be therefore of the droſſie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, as he would perſwade his Diſciples.</p>

                        <p>Laſtly, hee askes who can bring a cleane thing out of that which is vncleane? I anſwere, the Lord can; as hee brought light out of darkneſſe, and maketh him aliue by grace, who is dead in ſin. Alſo if the vncleane thing be not abſolutely vncleane, who need aske this queſtion: for out of that which is partly vncleane, and partly cleane; may a cleane thing be produced: now the Romiſh Church is not ſo vncleane, but there is ſome cleane things in it, as ſuch truths as wee doe hold and teach for the truths of God, by the warrant of the word. It is therefore no wonder, that any ſhould aske how cleane things may be brought from an vncleane thing, wherein cleane things are.</p>

That therefore if the heart and conſcience be conuerted, can that Miniſterie be denyed to haue an outward effect? If the firſt be true, as there hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, and alſo doth acknowledge the ſame of himſelfe in another place: then the latter cannot be denyed: for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if wee beleeue in the heart, wee will confeſſe with the mouth, as the inſtances of ſuch as were conuerted men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> doe declare. 3. In denying vs true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faith, hee ſpeaketh both falſely and moſt vnproperly, and ſo alſo abſurdly: <hi>falſely,</hi> for can there be inward conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not true faith? It is moſt ſtrange to heare of the hearts conuerſion, and of no Faith, when this is firſt, and the other followes vpon it: <hi>Abſurdly,</hi> in calling Faith a <hi>viſible</hi> thing; for it is the moſt ſecret grace, though from it doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe liuely fruits to demonſtrate it, which fruits neuertheleſſe are not Faith it ſelfe, no more then an effect may be called the cauſe of it ſelfe.

                           <hi>and eſtabliſhed in the true Church, if it may be found.</hi> This is moſt falſe, or moſt abſurd: firſt, his (<hi>if it may be found</hi>) ſhewes that there is a conuerſion belike ſome time, and not an eſtabliſhing of ſuch a one into a viſible Church: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what ſaith hee of the twelue men, Diſciples, Act. 19. 1. what viſible Aſſembly were they eſtabliſhed in? and yet
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:14152:170"/> were conuerted: thirdly, this is againſt the order of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing men into the true Church; for the Apoſtles did firſt iudge them conuerted to the true faith, before they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them into the Church, an inſtance is in <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. and ſo of all the reſt: and yet here this man ſaith, they be not conuerted to the true faith, before they be conuerted and eſtabliſhed in the true Church: <hi>Folly dwelleth with the wilfull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For my expounding the Scriptures, I referre them to the iudicious Reader to compare them together, and to the learned Commentaries of Diuines, amongſt other, M. <hi>Caluin,</hi> who calleth the Apoſtles <hi>worke, the conuerſion of the Corinthians, and that the Lord had ſealed his Apoſtleſhip by their faith, 1. Cor.</hi> 9. 1. 2. and ſaith alſo 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 3. that the Corinthians faith was the Apoſtles worke: his doctrine, the Lords effectual worke thereby.</hi> The bringing of people to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that, is more Apoſtolical, than the gathering of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies together, which both falſe Apoſtles, Heretiques, and Schiſmatickes haue done, and now doe. And whereas M. <hi>Smith,</hi> to make good his abuſing of the word by his wretched gloſſes, brings in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. where mention is<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7.</note> made of <hi>Moſes,</hi> a compariſon betweene the perſons of <hi>Moſes</hi> and S. <hi>Paul,</hi> as if the holy Ghoſt intended to ſet them two out, hee doth herein ſeduce his Diſciples, and abuſe the place; for there <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> are not compared, but the Goſpell and the Law, the miniſtration of both, by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of either Teſtament; of which ſee Interpreters vpon that place. The Apoſtle mentioneth not their gathering into a companie, but his teaching of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15. and winning of them to the profeſſion of Chriſt, which is their conuerſion to the faith of Chriſt, called the ſeale of his Apoſtleſhip, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2. by which they be made Chriſtians, and Gods Church, though they be not in one place. And thus much to this: I leaue his rayling and rauing ſpirit to be rebuked of him, who ſaith, that the <hi>rayler</hi> ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdome of God.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that which I ſpeake, page 129, 130. touching conuerſion by priuate perſons, hee would obſcure by a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:14152:170"/> tedious multiplicitie of words, in his Booke, page, 97. 98. but applyeth it not to ouerthrow my reaſons, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vntouched, and therefore till, as a direct anſwerer, he refell my reaſons, and make more euident the truth, I let him paſſe, as ſhooting at rouers, both deceitfully and idlie.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, to that which I ſay, touching the qualification of our Miniſters, their Calling, Doctrine, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, faithfull execution of their Miniſterie, conſcionable liuing, and Gods aſſiſtance in their labour. Hee tels vs if we would beleeue him, that the Popiſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters<note place="margin">Page. 99.</note> haue all theſe; and ſaith, <hi>that they doe preach the true doctrine of Chriſt, and adminiſter his true Sacraments,</hi> and ſo forth; proceeding to ſet out them to condemne vs, but all verbally, without proofe, and therefore I deny, what hee ſaith, till hee proue it, and in the meane ſpace deſire him a better guide then that lying ſpirit, euen the grace of Gods ſpirit, to learne him to ſpeake the truth.</p>
                        <p>In the next place, hee anſweres to the anſwere of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from popular power, to ouerthrow ordination by Biſhops, which before is replyed vnto. To my Similitude of marriage, that as a faulty entrance in marriage, ſo the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance be kept, cannot diſanull it being made, nor make it falſe; no more can a corrupt entrance into the Miniſterie, make it eyther a falſe, or no Miniſterie. Hee anſweres ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily thus much, that matter or forme being falſe, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance cannot be true: but hee ſaith, our Miniſterie can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, becauſe our Aſſemblies are falſe. Where <hi>firſt</hi> note his folly, how he maketh the Aſſemblies part of the Miniſterie, eyther for matter or forme of the Miniſterie, which was neuer heard of before; elſe why maketh hee the ſame the reaſon to ouerthrow either the matter or forme, which hee ſtood vpon, for other accidentall circumſtances diſanull not Gods ordinances, as he confeſſeth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> his ground is falſe; for wee be a true Church, and therefore by ſaying wee are a falſe Church, hee cannot proue our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie falſe; my ſimilie therefore is good, and not yet of leſſe force, by all that he hath ſaid.</p>

                        <p>Sixtly, and laſtly, to that which I ſay in my former booke<note place="margin">Page 144.</note> againſt their Miniſters, hee anſweres, and ſaith, that I call them <hi>vnlawfull,</hi> but I dare not ſay <hi>falſe:</hi> But if hee ſay true, himſelfe ſaith, the Browniſts Miniſters are Antichriſtian, &amp; ſuch are, by his owne account, falſe; and why may not I dare ſo to call them, if (I ſay) hee ſpeake truth: for himſelfe now I dare call him both an vnlawfull &amp; a falſe Miniſter; for that hee doth teach continually falſe and abſurd doctrines; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo hee peruerteth Gods truth, to the deſtruction of his followers, as is by me made manifeſt, and very effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in his anſwere vnto him, and ſo I hope will hee be more and more manifeſted by others an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſticall Heretique, and a man nothing but dreames, and vaine in his imaginations.</p>

                     <div n="1" type="argument">
                        <head>The firſt Argument.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>true worſhip of the Lord cannot poſſibly be offered vp in a falſe Church. The Eccleſiaſticall Aſſemblies of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>are falſe Churches.</hi> Ergo, <hi>the worſhip offered vp vnto the Lord in thoſe Aſſemblies is falſe worſhip.</hi> To paſſe by the <hi>maior</hi> not ſound, which he doth not proue, though he pretend onely the proofe of it: for hee ſaith, true worſhip is <note n="*" place="margin">Then by his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion it may be in it, els how can it defile the worſhip of God? ſo here he contradicts his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> defiled by a falſe Church, and that God will not haue euery Communion of men to ſerue him, and that it is not acceptable to him. This is the ſumme of his confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which how it proueth the <hi>maior,</hi> I leaue to be iudged. The <hi>minor</hi> I deny, which he proueth not, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it afore proued, which I haue diſproued: and ſo this Argument is eaſily anſwered.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="2" type="argument">

                        <head>The ſecond Argument.</head>
                        <p>THe <hi>worſhip which is offred vp vnto the Lord, by a falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie is a falſe worſhip. The Worſhip of the Eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies of England is offered vp by a falſe Miniſtery:</hi> Ergo, <hi>a falſe Worſhip.</hi> The <hi>Maior</hi> is ſtill vnſound, neyther doth he proue it otherwiſe then the former; to wit, by Gods not accepting the worſhip by a falſe Miniſterie but ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon proueth not the Worſhip it ſelfe falſe. God doth not accept of any wicked mans worſhipping of God in a true Church, by true Miniſters rightly worſhipping, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. Doth it therefore follow from Gods not acceptance for the mans wickedneſſe, that therefore the worſhip it ſelfe is falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and not of God? none can truely ſay ſo. The <hi>Minor</hi> is falſe as I haue proued before; and now not by him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued. So then the <hi>Maior</hi> being vnſound, and the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> falſe, this reaſon alſo is not worth a ruſh.</p>

                           <hi>IEwiſh,</hi> that is, <hi>literall, ſtinted, impoſed Booke-worſhip is falſe Worſhip.

                        <p>The ground of this Argument hee maketh his proofes out of his Booke intituled, <hi>The differences of the Churches of the Separation,</hi> to which hee <hi>referreth his Reader:</hi> now this booke of his, is ſince confuted in moſt things very ſoundly, but chiefely this propoſition here auouched by Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> who it ſeemeth can in a good cauſe do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily well, which I wiſh his imployment in euer, and ceaſe to defend vntruths againſt vs, in which hee is very barraine and without iudgement. Therefore for the Propoſition I doe commend to the Reader his <note n="*" place="margin">A defence of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Worſhip, and Miniſtery, againſt. Mr. <hi>Smith.</hi>
                           </note> Anſwere at large. The
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14152:175"/> 
                           <hi>Minor</hi> I deny, which vpon ſo falſe a propoſition he takes to be true, without further proofe: in which he denyeth all reading of Scripture; yea, ſo much as for a Preacher to looke vpon his Text of Scripture in the publike Aſſemblie: and yet if this Sathanicall bewitchment of him were true, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the <hi>Minor</hi> is in part falſe; for all our Worſhip is not literall, ſtinted, and impoſed vpon a Booke; for many Sermons are made by meditation, and vttered by the help of memorie without any Booke: ſo many prayers are made freely, as occaſion of times be, and not read vpon a Booke; ſo as herein he ſpeaketh vntruely of the Worſhip in all the Aſſemblies of the Church of England.</p>
                        <p>After theſe his Arguments, hee cauils with my reaſons in my former booke, <hi>firſt,</hi> preſſing his booke of differences,<note place="margin">Page. 105.</note> as if it were not confutable, but, as I haue ſaid, it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this point confuted to his ſhame. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to that I ſay, <hi>we doe worſhip no falſe Gods, nor the true God with</hi>
                           <note place="margin">My former Book. Pa. 146.</note> 
                           <hi>any falſe worſhip,</hi> and therefore our worſhip is not falſe: Hee anſweres, that <hi>Iſraell</hi> might ſo haue ſaid in <hi>Ieroboams</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Page 105.</note> time, and when <hi>Aaron</hi> made the Calfe. But how vniuſtly they might ſo ſay, as wee may, and how falſely this man vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth ſuch words, the holy Ghoſt himſelfe ſhall giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: for doth hee not ſay, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> had Prieſts <hi>for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 15.</note> and for the Calues which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had made? And is it not ſaid, that the Iſraelites did worſhip the Calfe, and that<note place="margin">

So they worſhipped Diuels, and falſe Gods, yea a molten image for God, how can it be ſaid then, that they might ſay, as we truely can, that we worſhip no falſe Gods, nor the true God with falſe worſhip, as they did?</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, hee taketh for graunted our worſhip to be the inuention of man, and ſo concludeth in a verball ſound of words without any proofe, as the Reader may ſee, that our<note place="margin">Page 106.</note> Church is a falſe Church, and ſo an Idoll our Seruice booke an Idoll: that wee haue a falſe Chriſt, and ſo an Idoll; and ſo hee ſaith that our faith is falſe; our doctrine falſe; the word not the true word; neither the Sacraments, nor our
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:14152:176"/> Communion true: all which if hee could as eaſily proue, as affirme, hee had needed no farther to haue troubled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with other diſcourſes, theſe had beene inough to haue remoued vs out of our way, or elſe to haue periſhed in our ſtanding: but ſithen hee, nor any ſchiſmaticall Heretike is euer able to iuſtifie this againſt vs, the contrary herefully being made plaine againſt him, hee is to be iudged, as ſuch wicked ſpeeches deſerue, ſo vttered againſt the true Church of God, and his mother, if hee be not euery way a Baſtard, vnworthie to be acknowledged a naturall and true Sonne. And thus alſo haue I ended with M. <hi>Smith,</hi> whoſe reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I wiſh, and not to preſume aboue that which is meet to vnderſtand, but to vnderſtand according to ſobrietie, and<note place="margin">

                        <p>There remaineth ſome-what to be replyed vnto vpon their anſweres vnto ſome particular opinions of theirs, ſet downe in my other Booke; but for that at the firſt I haue<note place="margin">Page 151.</note> mentioned them briefly, as to let the world iudge of the vanitie thereof, and conſidering they be of no moment from that which is already handled, which being throughly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, ſufficiently may furniſh the meaneſt Reader of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with better and more reaſons to anſwere them, then they haue ſaid to defend them; and laſtly, this my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply being growne into ſo great a quantitie, I paſſe them by, and leaue them, as not fearing any indifferent Reader to be ſeduced by them in ſuch things.</p>
                        <p>For a Concluſion, I wiſh them to conſider the truths of<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> God, to acknowledge vs the true Church of God, as we be indeed; let them not by a falſe condemnation of vs, in what wee are not to be condemned; maintaine therein their Schiſme from vs, and by vntruths ſeeke eyther to draw more, or hold whom they haue ſo gotten from vs, through errour of their mindes. If M. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> can proue ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, that wee be <hi>no Church of Chriſt,</hi> this one matter is ſufficient to inſiſt vpon, to remoue any honeſt heart fearing God, to fly from euery thing which may iuſtly be diſliked in any Aſſembly; but if not, let Gods feare appeare in them;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:14152:176"/> let ſincere loue of true ſpeaking declare it ſelfe in them, by acknowledging vs to be what wee are by the warrant of the Word; and ceaſe to call vs falſe Churches, Antichriſtian Churches, ſo ſhall they be leſſe condemned, and the truth on both ſides appearing, peace will follow, and with truth holineſſe, without which none ſhall ſee God.</p>
                        <p>Thou ſeeſt, Reader, the cauſes ſufficient to holde thee<note place="margin">A briefe repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reaſons againſt them.</note> backe from the Separatiſts Schiſme: <hi>We are a Church truely conſtituted; by lawfull meanes reformed; Saints by calling; that their is no example or warrant for any to ſeparate from ſuch a church as ours is, as they doe, with condemnation. It is oppoſed by the godly Learned: no Church giueth them the right hand of fellowſhip: The Lord hath by his fearefull hand reproued the Ring-leaders. It is like old Schiſmaticks: it is occaſioned through diſcontentment; violence of paſſion enforceth it: igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with a good meaning in many vpholds it: if euer they had grace, here in England they found it: here wee feele the power of the word: here are ſuch as truely feare God: the beſt churches hold vs a true Church; God hath adorned it with worthy men of God, and with the crowne of Martyrdome. The Godly here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, are more charitable then the Separation:</hi> wee carry a pitty to them, and yet they doe reiect all communion with vs: yea, behold <hi>how Sathan confounds them by diuiſions, and how deadly they condemne one another.</hi>
